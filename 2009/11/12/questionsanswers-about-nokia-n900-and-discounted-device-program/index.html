<meta name="description" content="Being one of the developers who received the discount to buy a N900, during these days I contacted the DDP customer care to have more informations and details. I&#39;ll publish here both my original question and the official reply. 1) The price of N900 is 250€ and I&#39;ve read of people who paid it this price. Anyway here you say that the VAT is not included: https://pro.forum.nokia.com/site/global/tech_resources/discounted_devices/l_ddp.jsp so it should costs 300€ not 250€, right? The VAT applies only for Finnish developers, for the others the price is the price they see in the eStore, no VAT is added to that. So, all non-finnish european people, will pay 250€ for the N900. 2) How much time can I wait before ordering it? In this moment I&#39;m in Valencia (Spain) and I won&#39;t come back to Italy before Christmas. I&#39;d like the order to be shipped to my home in Italy (I registered as italian user and I want italian keyboard layout), but I&#39;d like to wait to order it, because since there&#39;s no warranty and I need to tell you about any problem within a week, if I order it now I will be able to check it only at the end of december when I&#39;ll come back to Italy. I guess this should not be a problem. This part is not confirmed yet, since Quim told us to hurry up to buy it. 3) How many devices can I buy at that price? Here you say I can buy two: https://pro.forum.nokia.com/site/global/tech_resources/discounted_devices/l_ddp.jsp but here you say I can buy one: https://pro.forum.nokia.com/showProduct.do?product_id=5096 I don&#39;t want two devices, but another friend of mine, who help me in a project for the Maemo Community, would like to be able to buy one for the same price (he wasn&#39;t able to get the discount because his karma is still low). As far as I know, you can only purchase 1x device per person, regarding MAEMO N900. 4) Where can we find the new firmware? In the FAQ you say: DDP does not flash devices. It&#39;s ok, I can do it, but there&#39;s no public firmware for N900 at the moment. To update N900, can possibly be using NSU. Nokia software updater. 5) Is it possible to have a device with localized keyboard (for example italian one) ? All N900 will have EURO variant, Italian language is one option. Note: even these replies come from the official customer care, I don&#39;t assume any responsability if they shouldn&#39;t be all exact. If you have any doubt, please contact them directly at DDP.program@nokia.com" />

    <p>Being one of the developers who received the discount to buy a N900,
during these days I contacted the DDP customer care to have more
informations and details. I'll publish here both my original question
and the official reply.</p>
<p><strong>1) The price of N900 is 250€ and I've read of people who paid it this

<p><em>So, all non-finnish european people, will pay <strong>250€</strong> for the N900.</em></p>
