Having the opportunity to work both with C (yes, Python bindings are almost C code) and Python (it&#39;s a good practice to write unittest of all implemented methods) it&#39;s a good way to improve my knowledges in both languages and since I wasn&#39;t able to find much documentation about these kind of things, I&#39;m going to share my own experiences. What is a Binding? A binding is a Python module, written in C language, that allows Python developers to call functions from existing C libraries from their python applications. It&#39;s just like a &#34;bridge&#34; from C world to Python one. Why writing bindings? There are a couple of reasons to write python bindings instead of writing a library in python language from scratch. First of all I don&#39;t think is good duplicating code, so if a library already exists and it&#39;s written in C, why writing it again in another language? There&#39;s no reason. A lot of code already exist in C world and all we have to do is to create a bridge with python world. Another good reason, in particular when a C library doesn&#39;t exist yet, is the fact that python code is slower than C code for some tasks (for example multimedia codecs). In these cases is good to implement the core library in C language and then create a python binding for it.

Next posts will talk about these things: A simple example of binding: I&#39;ll write a simple library in C language and I&#39;ll show how to create the relative python binding, providing complete source code and an example for python developers. Building and installing python bindings with distutils: I&#39;ll explain how to use distutils to build and install the binding (using the well know method &#34;python setup.py install&#34;). Defining new types: this post will be about how to write new types in C language and being able to use them from python code.

    <p>This summer I'm having the pleasure of working in
<a href="http://www.igalia.com"><strong>Igalia</strong></a> (a spanish free software company)
for a couple of months and they assigned me to an interesting project:
developing <strong>Python bindings</strong> for <strong>MAFW</strong> library (a <strong>Maemo</strong>
multimedia library that will be used in <strong>Fremantle</strong> release).</p>
<p>Having the opportunity to work both with <strong>C</strong> (yes, Python bindings are
almost C code) and <strong>Python</strong> (it's a good practice to write unittest of
all implemented methods) it's a good way to improve my knowledges in
both languages and since I wasn't able to find much documentation about
these kind of things, I'm going to share my own experiences.</p>
<h2>What is a Binding?</h2>

applications. It's just like a "<em>bridge</em>" from C world to Python one.</p>
<h2>Why writing bindings?</h2>

about any argument you would like to read, please feel free to leave me
a comment. Next posts will talk about these things:</p>

<li><strong>A simple example of binding:</strong> I'll write a simple library in C
