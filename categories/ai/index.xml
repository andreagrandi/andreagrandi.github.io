&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the past few days &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;&lt;strong&gt;Claude Code&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; had some reliability issues and was sometimes unavailable. I started looking for alternative solutions (for context: through my job, I already have paid subscriptions to &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://github.com/features/copilot&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;&lt;strong&gt;GitHub Copilot&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://chatgpt.com&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;&lt;strong&gt;ChatGPT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) but I wanted something that would better fit my workflow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I initially used Copilot in &lt;strong&gt;VSCode&lt;/strong&gt;, in the last month I‚Äôve mostly been using VSCode for small fixes, code reviews, and navigating the codebase (asking questions using &lt;code&gt;@workspace&lt;/code&gt; still beats any other tool I‚Äôve tried so far). I was primarily using Claude Code (I have a &lt;strong&gt;Pro&lt;/strong&gt; subscription, which is usually enough for my needs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I discovered &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://opencode.ai&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;&lt;strong&gt;OpenCode&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and liked that it‚Äôs not tied to a single provider‚Äîit can be used with most existing subscriptions and API keys (in particular, &lt;strong&gt;you can use your existing Claude Code Pro/Max or GitHub Copilot subscription&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having recently worked on a task at work (which I admit it&amp;rsquo;s simple to medium difficulty), after work I decided to give the same task to Claude Code and OpenCode (used with different models) logged in with my GitHub Copilot subscription.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-task&#34;&gt;The Task
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I won&amp;rsquo;t (and I can&amp;rsquo;t) go into specific details of the task, since it&amp;rsquo;s work stuff, but I can say it was about:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;add a new field &lt;code&gt;new_field&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;ExistingEntity&lt;/code&gt; entity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;add &lt;code&gt;new_field&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;ExistingModel&lt;/code&gt; model&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;create an &lt;code&gt;alembic&lt;/code&gt; migration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;fix existing tests&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-results&#34;&gt;The results
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, the code produced by these models was correct (with one exception), but in a few cases I had to make some manual fixes or request a second iteration, specifying what needed to be corrected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;claude-code&#34;&gt;Claude Code
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Claude was, hands down, the best overall. The initial iteration had a couple of minor problems:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the field was marked as not nullable while I wanted it nullable, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t specify this initially so it couldn&amp;rsquo;t guess it correctly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the default value given to the field was quite &amp;ldquo;odd&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;opencode-copilotsonnet-4&#34;&gt;OpenCode (copilot/sonnet-4)
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;OpenCode (configured with the Anthropic &lt;code&gt;sonnet-4&lt;/code&gt; model from Copilot) unsurprisingly produced almost the same code as Claude Code (with the same minor problems), but it also reformatted some existing code without permission. Last but not least, it added two tests (like Claude), but it removed six existing ones üò®&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had to iterate and tell it to fix, which was very quick to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;opencode-copilotgemini-pro-25&#34;&gt;OpenCode (copilot/gemini-pro-2.5)
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gemini‚Ä¶ oh dear! I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs the model itself or if it‚Äôs just not optimized for agentic coding (though it should be, since Google just released &lt;code&gt;gemini-cli&lt;/code&gt; ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è). It started hallucinating (I could see this as the code was being written) about existing fixtures, added a new unnecessary one, duplicated some existing code, and completely rewrote an existing class‚Äîin a bad way‚Äîinstead of importing it. I honestly didn‚Äôt try a second iteration; I just scrapped the whole thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;opencode-copilotgpt-41&#34;&gt;OpenCode (copilot/gpt-4.1)
&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last, but not least, I switched to &lt;code&gt;gpt-4.1&lt;/code&gt; from the Copilot subscription. The first iteration wasn‚Äôt perfect (it was probably a bit inferior to the one produced by &lt;code&gt;sonnet-4&lt;/code&gt;) and needed a couple of fixes, but once I told it what to correct, it did so quickly, and the final version was perfect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bonus point: using &lt;code&gt;gpt-4.1&lt;/code&gt; through a Copilot subscription offers &lt;strong&gt;unlimited&lt;/strong&gt; usage üéâ&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best tool I‚Äôve tried so far remains Claude Code, but I have to admit that OpenCode with &lt;code&gt;sonnet-4&lt;/code&gt; could replace it soon (especially considering it was released less than a month ago). Even &lt;code&gt;gpt-4.1&lt;/code&gt; wasn‚Äôt bad, and honestly, using it through OpenCode yields much better results than using it from within VSCode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All three models I used with OpenCode tried to reformat existing code. This must be an OpenCode bug, which I‚Äôve tried to mitigate with a rule in the &lt;code&gt;AGENT.md&lt;/code&gt; file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will keep testing OpenCode over the next few days, and maybe I‚Äôll write a dedicated review about it.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;img src="https://www.andreagrandi.it/posts/ai-wont-take-your-job-yet/ai-doing-developers-work-cover.webp" alt="Featured image of post AI won‚Äôt take your Software Developer job (not yet)" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the last 3 days I had the opportunity to participate to an internal hackathon organised by the company I work for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had to build a project based on an SDK and the needed skills to build it were those of a frontend developer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being a backend developer and having very basic (almost none) frontend skills, I was suggested to use ChatGPT to write some of the code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;challenge-accepted&#34;&gt;Challenge accepted
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course I accepted and I worked on the project with another colleague (also backend developer) who also used ChatGPT to write some of the code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-i-normally-use-chatgpt&#34;&gt;How I normally use ChatGPT
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;ChatGPT is not new to me. I use it daily for my work, but I mostly use it as a &amp;ldquo;search engine on steroids&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than searching something on a search engine, read a few blog posts or forums, then landing on a Stack Overflow page, to find some code and adapt it, I ask the same question to ChatGPT and then I adapt the produced example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I never ask for a complete feature or even a whole method. I usually need a small example for a very specific thing which I then insert in an existing code base.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-i-used-it-for-the-hackathon&#34;&gt;How I used it for the hackathon
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the case of the hackathon, I knew what I wanted to achieve, but I had no idea how to do it, so I asked it to produce almost everything I needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the beginning it was easy: I had nothing and I was adding small pieces every time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a little bit I ended up with a lot of code I couldn&amp;rsquo;t understand anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was having an issue with the produced code and ChatGPT, instead of helping, started to allucinate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of asking it to fix a specific issue, I was passing back the whole JavaScript file, asking for the issues to be corrected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t notice that while fixing the issues, ChatGPT was also rewriting the whole file and in a couple of occasions it started changing the logic entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The errors disappeared but the code started behaving differently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end we had to revert to a simpler and older version of our code, which at least was working correctly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion
&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I remain confident that tools like ChatGPT can be valuable assets for software developers, provided they already possess a strong understanding of the relevant domain, such as Python backend development in my experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, for areas outside one&amp;rsquo;s expertise, such as frontend development, relying solely on ChatGPT is insufficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is your experience with similar tools? Let me know in the comments.&lt;/p&gt;
