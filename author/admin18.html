</footer><!-- /.post-info -->                <p>I don't know if it's just a case or if I'm the only one who had these
problems, but I'll report them anyway, maybe somebody had my same
problem and we could try to prepare a proper bug report to make the
Maemo team fix them.</p>
<h2>Infinite boot loop after upgrade</h2>
<p>First of all I have to say that before upgrading to PR 1.1.1 I checked
if I had enough space on the rootfs. I only had 27 Mb and so I decided
to remove some unused applications, deleted some *.deb in
/var/cache/apt/archives and disabled extras repositories. Of course I
also did a backup of all my configuration. After the cleaning operation
I had near 60 Mb free on rootfs, enough to install the upgrade.</p>
<p>I closed all running applications, started the application manager and
began the upgrade. After the upgrade was completed, the device did a
reboot... then another one, then again, again.... until I had to remove
the battery to stop it.</p>
<p>Conclusion: I had to re-flash the device with the latest image to make
it work again.</p>
<h2>mafw-dbus-wrapper taking all the CPU</h2>
<p>I was watching a video (using subtitles) and after some minutes the
whole UI became unresponsive. Strange because I already did this before
without having any problem. I tried to check the problem using "top"
utility from terminal and I saw that there was a mafw process
(mafw-dbus-wrapper) that was taking 80-90% of CPU. My fault is that
normally there are at least 3-4 , mafw-dbus-wrapper processes and I
didn't check which one was causing the problem. Anyway I made a
screenshot, just in case it can help.</p>

least investigate what happened. Just leave a comment or contact me if
you need more informations.</p>

</footer><!-- /.post-info -->                <h2>Introduction</h2>
<p><img alt="" src="http://www.andreagrandi.it/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/fon-300x294.jpg" title="fon">{.alignright
.size-medium .wp-image-336 width="168" height="164"}As many of you
already know, <strong>Fon</strong> is a spanish company that some years ago had the
interesting idea of creating a <strong>wifi community</strong> to share the Internet
connection. The idea is quite simple: each "fonero" buy a Fonera (the
router sold by Fon), register it on the Fon system and get a
username/password. If the fonero travels around the world he's able to
connect to wifi signal of other foneras and browse the web for free.</p>
<p>When I bought my first fonera few years ago, I was one of the first
people in my city. I bought it because I was really beliving in this
project. During these years Fon produced new models of fonera and I
bought each of them (the WRT54 router, Fonera, Fonera+, Fonera 2.0g,
Fonera 2.0n ecc....). Since first year, the Fon community has grown a
lot and now there are a lot of foneros around the world.</p>
<h2>Actual situation</h2>
<p>Few months ago Fon launched a very interesting product: <strong>Fonera 2.0g</strong>.
Thats's not only a router. Fonera 2 is capable of managing torrents,
rapidshare downloads, uploading photo on Facebook and Flickr, and much
more. Whats's wrong with this product? It's <strong>very unstable</strong>! There are
a lot of users that bought this router when it was anounced and they're
still waiting for a lot of bugs to be fixed by Fon developers team
(composed by only ONE person!). Why users had to wait so long?</p>
<p>Simple! They were working to Fonera 2.0n! Wow! Faster router, more RAM,
4 ethernet port, wonderful! But... another very unstable router! And
with unstable I mean: it <strong>disconnects/reboots often</strong>, connection is
unstable, applications don't work ecc.... I'm talking about a 79€
router, not about something that users had as preview product. Me and
other users were still waiting for an uograde when... Fon <a href="http://english.martinvarsavsky.net/general/fon-to-unveil-new-fonera-at-mobile-world-congress.html">announced a
new
product</a>!
Yes, another one!</p>
<p>Fon priority is not to fix a product that thousand of users have already
bought. Fon priority is to produce and sell a new product!</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>It could be only my opinion, but I don't trust you anymore Fon! I'm
really disappointed about your behaviour you had with your customers.
I've already spent (wasted) a lot of money with your not-working
products and I'm not going to buy your products anymore! I'm tired of
being illuded by your promises: how long are you going to play tricks on
users?</p>

</footer><!-- /.post-info -->                <p>Being one of the developers who received the discount to buy a N900,
during these days I contacted the DDP customer care to have more
informations and details. I'll publish here both my original question
and the official reply.</p>
<p><strong>1) The price of N900 is 250€ and I've read of people who paid it this
price. Anyway here you say that the VAT is not included:<br>
<a href="https://pro.forum.nokia.com/site/global/tech_resources/discounted_devices/l_ddp.jsp">https://pro.forum.nokia.com/site/global/tech_resources/discounted_devices/l_ddp.jsp</a><br>
so it should costs 300€ not 250€, right?</strong></p>
<p>The VAT applies only for Finnish developers, for the others the price is
the price they see in the eStore, no VAT is added to that.</p>
<p><em>So, all non-finnish european people, will pay <strong>250€</strong> for the N900.</em></p>
<p><strong>2) How much time can I wait before ordering it? In this moment I'm in
Valencia (Spain) and I won't come back to Italy before Christmas. I'd
like the order to be shipped to my home in Italy (I registered as
italian user and I want italian keyboard layout), but I'd like to wait
to order it, because since there's no warranty and I need to tell you
about any problem within a week, if I order it now I will be able to
check it only at the end of december when I'll come back to Italy.</strong></p>
<p>I guess this should not be a problem.</p>
<p><em>This part is not confirmed yet, since Quim told us to hurry up to buy
it.</em></p>
<p><strong>3) How many devices can I buy at that price? Here you say I can
buy two:<br>
<a href="https://pro.forum.nokia.com/site/global/tech_resources/discounted_devices/l_ddp.jsp">https://pro.forum.nokia.com/site/global/tech_resources/discounted_devices/l_ddp.jsp</a><br>
but here you say I can buy one:
<a href="https://pro.forum.nokia.com/showProduct.do?product_id=5096">https://pro.forum.nokia.com/showProduct.do?product_id=5096</a></p>
<p>I don't want two devices, but another friend of mine, who help me in a
project for the Maemo Community, would like to be able to buy one for
the same price (he wasn't able to get the discount because his karma is
still low).</strong></p>
<p>As far as I know, you can only purchase 1x device per person, regarding
MAEMO N900.</p>
<p><strong>4) Where can we find the new firmware? In the FAQ you say: DDP does
not flash devices. It's ok, I can do it, but there's no public firmware
for N900 at the moment.</strong></p>
<p>To update N900, can possibly be using NSU. Nokia software updater.</p>
<p><strong>5) Is it possible to have a device with localized keyboard (for
example italian one) ?</strong></p>
<p>All N900 will have EURO variant, Italian language is one option.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> even these replies come from the official customer care, I
don't assume any responsability if they shouldn't be all exact. If you
have any doubt, please contact them directly at
