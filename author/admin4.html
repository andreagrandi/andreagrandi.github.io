</footer><!-- /.post-info -->                <p>In <strong>Go</strong> it's possible to define <strong>methods</strong> on <strong>struct types</strong>. The
syntax needed for it can be a bit strange for people that are used to
define classes and methods in Java, C# etc... but once you learn it
it's quite easy to use.</p>
<p>In my case for example I needed something that could contain a Timer
object, a string and a method that could start the timer and call a
method at the end of the Timer execution. I implemented it in this way:</p>
<p>``` {.toolbar:2 .lang:go .decode:true}
type DeviceTimer struct {
    DeviceID    string
    DeviceTimer *time.Timer
}</p>
<p>func (timer DeviceTimer) startTimer() {
    &lt;-timer.DeviceTimer.C
    notifyDeviceTimerExpired(timer.DeviceID)
}</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>The key point is **row 6** &quot;*func (timer DeviceTimer) startTimer() { ...
}*&quot; where I defined a method called **startTimer** and I specify timer
**DeviceTimer** inside the func definition. This basically &quot;extends&quot; the
struct DeviceTimer adding that method to it. This means that I can call
that method in this way:

``` {.toolbar:2 .lang:go .decode:true}
timer := time.NewTimer(time.Millisecond * 300)
device_timer := DeviceTimer{&quot;abc123&quot;, timer}
go device_timer.startTimer()
</pre></div>


<p>This is all you need to do. If you want to read more about this subject,
I can suggest to read these two articles:</p>

</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> I'm not a Go expert and these are just my personal notes I'm
taking during my learning experience. I'm very keen to share my notes
with everyone, but please don't take them as notes from an expert Go
developer.</p>

</footer><!-- /.post-info -->                <p>I've been recently concerned about <a href="https://plus.google.com/+MayurKamat/posts/ETBvtp9VYav">the
future</a> of
<strong>Google Talk</strong> service and all the implications related to recent
changes to the existing service. What has been a nice implementation of
the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XMPP">Jabber/XMPP</a> protocol once, now
is just a <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/05/google-abandons-open-standards-instant-messaging">closed and
proprietary</a>
service. The main problem with these changes are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jabber/XMPP users of other services won't be able to talk anymore to
    Google Talk users</li>
<li>Google is killing some of their native clients (like the Windows
    one) and forcing users to Chrome or Android/iOS versions</li>
<li>Google has disabled the possibility to turn off chat recording (you
    can still do it individually, for each contact)</li>
</ul>
<p>So, what are the alternatives to Google Talk? Luckly you have at least
three options.</p>
<h2>Using an existing Jabber/XMPP service</h2>
<p>This is surely the easiest way to get a Jabber/XMPP account. There is a
list of free services available
here: <a href="https://xmpp.net/directory.php">https://xmpp.net/directory.php</a> registering a new account is
usually very easy. Most of the clients have an option that let you
register the account while you are configuring it. For example if you
are using <a href="https://www.pidgin.im"><strong>Pidgin</strong></a> and you want to register
an account with
<a href="https://duck.co/blog/using-pidgin-with-xmpp-jabber">DukGo</a> service, you
can configure it in this way:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.andreagrandi.it/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/2_addaccount.png"><img alt="2_addaccount" src="http://www.andreagrandi.it/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/2_addaccount.png">{.aligncenter
.size-full .wp-image-928 width="348"
height="531"}</a></p>
<h2>Using an hosted Jabber/XMPP service with your domain</h2>
<p>A service called <a href="http://hosted.im"><strong>HostedIM</strong></a> offer a very nice
service. Basically if you already have a domain, you can register an
account on <a href="http://hosted.im">hosted.im</a>, setup your <strong>DNS</strong> following
their instructions and create an account directly on their dashboard.
You can create up to <strong>5 accounts for free</strong>. If you need more, they
offer a paid service for that. In my case all I had to do was updating
my DNS with the following configuration:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>_xmpp-client._tcp.andreagrandi.it. IN SRV 10 0 5222 xmpp1.hosted.im.
_xmpp-client._tcp.andreagrandi.it. IN SRV 20 0 5222 xmpp2.hosted.im.
_xmpp-server._tcp.andreagrandi.it. IN SRV 20 0 5269 xmpp2.hosted.im.
_xmpp-server._tcp.andreagrandi.it. IN SRV 10 0 5269 xmpp1.hosted.im.
_jabber._tcp.andreagrandi.it. IN SRV 20 0 5269 xmpp2.hosted.im.
_jabber._tcp.andreagrandi.it. IN SRV 10 0 5269 xmpp1.hosted.im.
</pre></div>


<h2>Hosting your own Jabber/XMPP service</h2>
<p>If you have a VPS and some syasdmin skills, why not hosting your own
XMPP server? There are different options available, but I can suggest
you three in particular:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.igniterealtime.org/projects/openfire/">OpenFire</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.ejabberd.im/">ejabberd</a></li>
<li><a href="http://prosody.im/">Prosody</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I haven't tried any of these personally, because for the moment I'm
using the service offered by hosted.im. I'm curious anyway to configure
at least one of them and when I will do it I will publish a dedicated
tutorial about it.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Given the recent changes that Google is doing to all their services, I'm
more than happy when I can abandon one of them, because I personally
don't like to rely (and bind myself) to a single company, expecially if
that company closes a service whenever they want and try to lock you
inside their ecosystem.</p>

</footer><!-- /.post-info -->                <p>If you are planning to share an encrypted volume between Linux/OSX and
Windows (I will assume you are sharing it on Dropbox, but you could use
any similar service) and you are using
<a href="http://www.arg0.net/encfs"><strong>EncFS</strong></a> under Linux/OSX and
<a href="https://www.boxcryptor.com"><strong>BoxCryptor</strong></a> under Windows, there are
some specifig settings to use when you create the EncFS volume. Infact
even if BoxCryptor claims to be "encfs compatible", it's not 100%.</p>
<p>Suppose you want to create an encrypted volume located at
<strong>\$HOME/.TestTmpEncrypted</strong> and mounted at <strong>\$HOME/TestTmp</strong> you need
the following command:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>andrea-Inspiron-660:~ andrea $ encfs ~/.TestTmpEncrypted ~/TestTmp
</pre></div>


<p>answer "Y" when you are asked if you want to create the folders:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>The directory &quot;/home/andrea/.TestTmpEncrypted/&quot; does not exist. Should it be created? (y,n) y
The directory &quot;/home/andrea/TestTmp&quot; does not exist. Should it be created? (y,n) y
</pre></div>


<p>At this point you will need to select between default paranoia mode or
advanced mode. Please choose the <strong>advanced</strong> one (x):</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Creating new encrypted volume.
Please choose from one of the following options:
 enter &quot;x&quot; for expert configuration mode,
 enter &quot;p&quot; for pre-configured paranoia mode,
 anything else, or an empty line will select standard mode.
?&gt; x
</pre></div>


<p>Manual configuration mode selected.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Select AES as cypher algorithm:

The following cypher algorithms are available:
1. AES : 16 byte block cipher
-- Supports key lengths of 128 to 256 bits
-- Supports block sizes of 64 to 4096 bytes
2. Blowfish : 8 byte block cypher
-- Supports key lengths of 128 to 256 bits
-- Supports block sizes of 64 to 4096 bytes

Enter the number corresponding to your choice: 1

Selected algorithm &quot;AES&quot;
</pre></div>


<p>Select <strong>256</strong> as key size:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Please select a key size in bits. The cypher you have chosen
supports sizes from 128 to 256 bits in increments of 64 bits.
For example:
128, 192, 256
Selected key size: 256

Using key size of 256 bits
</pre></div>


<p>Choose <strong>1024</strong> as block size:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Select a block size in bytes. The cypher you have chosen
supports sizes from 64 to 4096 bytes in increments of 16.
Alternatively, just press enter for the default (1024 bytes)

filesystem block size:

Using filesystem block size of 1024 bytes
</pre></div>


<p>Select <strong>Stream</strong> as filename encoding:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>The following filename encoding algorithms are available:
1. Block : Block encoding, hides file name size somewhat
2. Null : No encryption of filenames
3. Stream : Stream encoding, keeps filenames as short as possible

Enter the number corresponding to your choice: 3

Selected algorithm &quot;Stream&quot;&quot;
</pre></div>


<p>Do <strong>NOT</strong> enable <strong>filename initialization vector chaining</strong>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Enable filename initialization vector chaining?
This makes filename encoding dependent on the complete path,
rather then encoding each path element individually.
The default here is Yes.
Any response that does not begin with &#39;n&#39; will mean Yes: no
</pre></div>


<p>Do <strong>NOT</strong> enable <strong>per-file initialization vectors</strong>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Enable per-file initialization vectors?
This adds about 8 bytes per file to the storage requirements.
It should not affect performance except possibly with applications
which rely on block-aligned file io for performance.
The default here is Yes.
Any response that does not begin with &#39;n&#39; will mean Yes: no
</pre></div>


<p>Do <strong>NOT</strong> enable <strong>external chained IV</strong>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>External chained IV disabled, as both &#39;IV chaining&#39;
and &#39;unique IV&#39; features are required for this option.
Enable block authentication code headers
on every block in a file? This adds about 12 bytes per block
to the storage requirements for a file, and significantly affects
performance but it also means [almost] any modifications or errors
within a block will be caught and will cause a read error.
The default here is No.
Any response that does not begin with &#39;y&#39; will mean No: no
</pre></div>


<p>Do <strong>NOT</strong> enable <strong>random bytes to each block header</strong>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Add random bytes to each block header?
This adds a performance penalty, but ensures that blocks
have different authentication codes. Note that you can
have the same benefits by enabling per-file initialisation
vectors, which does not come with as great a performance
penalty.
Select a number of bytes, from 0 (no random bytes) to 8: 0
</pre></div>


<p>Enable <strong>file-hole pass-through</strong>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Enable file-hole pass-through?
This avoids writing encrypted blocks when file holes are created.
The default here is Yes.
Any response that does not begin with &#39;n&#39; will mean Yes: yes
</pre></div>


<p>Finally you will see:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Configuration finished. The filesystem to be created has
the following properties:
Filesystem cypher: &quot;ssl/aes&quot;, version 3:0:2
Filename encoding: &quot;nameio/stream&quot;, version 2:1:2
Key Size: 256 bits
Block Size: 1024 bytes
File holes passed through to ciphertext.
</pre></div>


<p>At this point set a passphrase for your new volume:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Now you will need to enter a password for your filesystem.
You will need to remember this password, as there is absolutely
no recovery mechanism. However, the password can be changed
later using encfsctl.

<p>You should be able to mount this volume using BoxCryptor.</p>

</footer><!-- /.post-info -->                <p>Developing a large web application or before deploying some code is very
important to verify the quality of the code itself, check if we have
introduced any regression or bug and have something that tell us if we
are increasing or decreasing the quality of the code.</p>
<p>Suppose we are in an organization or a company where the basic rule is:
<strong>master</strong> branch is always ready/stable to be deployed. In a team
usually people work on personal branches, then when the code is stable
it's merged with master.</p>
<p>How do we check if the code is stable and ready to be merged? First of
all we need to cover all our code with <strong>proper tests</strong> (I won't go in
details about unit testing here, I assume that the reader knows what I'm
talking about), then we need to actually run them, possibly in an
isolated environment that is similar to the production one, and check if
they all pass. If they do, we are quite safe to merge our code with
master branch.</p>
<p>How can we ensure that all the developers remember to run tests when
they push some new code? To make things a bit more real, let's take the
example of a Python/Django product (or even a library) that currently
supports <strong>Python 2.6, 2.7, 3.3</strong> and <strong>Django 1.4.x, 1.5.x, 1.6.x</strong>.
The whole matrix consists of <strong>9 possible combinations</strong>. Do we have to
manually run tests on 9 configurations? No, we don't.</p>
<h2>Travis-ci.org</h2>
<p><strong>Travis</strong> is a continuous integration tool that, once configured, takes
care of these tasks and let us save lot of time (that we can use to
actually write code). <a href="https://travis-ci.org">Travis-ci.org</a> is an
online service that works with <a href="https://github.com"><strong>GitHub</strong></a> (it
requires we use GitHub as repository for our code), and once we have
connected the two accounts and configured a very simple file in our
projects, it's automatically triggered when we push on our GitHub
repository.</p>
<p>The configuration consists of adding a file named <strong>.travis.yml</strong> in the
root of our project. A working example is available here
<a href="https://github.com/andreagrandi/workshopvenues/blob/master/.travis.yml">https://github.com/andreagrandi/workshopvenues/blob/master/.travis.yml</a>
(all the env variables I set are not required normally, but that's where
I save the values of my configuration, so they need to be initialized
before I can run tests).</p>
<p>The service supports most of the languages that are commonly used and
even a good number of PAAS, making it very easy to automatically
<strong>deploy</strong> our code. If it should not be enough for your needs, they
also expose a public <strong>API</strong>. I suggest you to give a look at the
official documentation that will explain everything in details
<a href="http://docs.travis-ci.com">http://docs.travis-ci.com</a></p>
<p>Once everything is configured, we will have something like this on our
console
<a href="https://travis-ci.org/andreagrandi/workshopvenues/jobs/19882128">https://travis-ci.org/andreagrandi/workshopvenues/jobs/19882128</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.andreagrandi.it/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/travis-ci-console.png"><img alt="travis-ci-console" src="http://www.andreagrandi.it/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/travis-ci-console-1024x544.png">{.aligncenter
.wp-image-832 width="614"
height="326"}</a></p>
<p>If something goes wrong (if tests don't pass for example) we receive a
notification with all the informations about the failing build, and if
we had configured an automatic deployment of course the code would not
be deployed in case of a failing build.</p>
<p>Travis-ci.org is <strong>completly free</strong> for opensource projects and has also
a paid version for private repositories.</p>
<h2 id="coveralls.io" style="text-align: left;">Coveralls.io</h2>
<p>There is a nice tool available for Python called
<a href="http://nedbatchelder.com/code/coverage"><strong>coverage</strong></a>. Basically it
runs tests and checks the percentage of the source code that is covered
by tests, producing a nice report that shows us the percentage for every
single file/module and even the lines of code that have been tested.</p>
<p>Thanks to Coveralls.io and the use of Travis, even these tasks are
completly automatized and the results are available online like in this
example <a href="https://coveralls.io/builds/560853">https://coveralls.io/builds/560853</a></p>
<p>The configuration is quite easy. We need to connect our Coveralls.io
profile with GitHub, like we did for Travis-ci.org and then enable the
repository. To trigger Coveralls after a successful Travis build, we
need to have these lines at the end of our <strong>.travis.yml</strong> file</p>

Even Coveralls.io is <strong>completly free</strong> for opensource projects and
offers a paid version for private repositories.</p>
<h2>Heroku</h2>
<p>I use <a href="https://www.heroku.com"><strong>Heroku</strong></a> to host and run my web
application. Normally to deploy on Heroku you so something like this:
<strong>git push heroku master</strong></p>
<p>Adding these settings to the <strong>.travis.yaml</strong> file, I can automatically
deploy the application on Heroku, if the build was successful:</p>

    <span class="o">-</span> <span class="s2">&quot;python workshopvenues/manage.py syncdb&quot;</span>
    <span class="o">-</span> <span class="s2">&quot;python workshopvenues/manage.py migrate&quot;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Not only the code is deployed, after deployment the <strong>South migrations</strong>
are executed.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>These two tools are saving me lot of time and are ensuring that the code
I release for a project I'm working on
(<a href="https://github.com/andreagrandi/workshopvenues"><strong>WorkshopVenues</strong></a>)
is always tested when I push it on my repository.</p>
