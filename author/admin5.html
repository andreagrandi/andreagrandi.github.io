</footer><!-- /.post-info -->                <p>If you are planning to share an encrypted volume between Linux/OSX and
Windows (I will assume you are sharing it on Dropbox, but you could use
any similar service) and you are using
<a href="http://www.arg0.net/encfs"><strong>EncFS</strong></a> under Linux/OSX and
<a href="https://www.boxcryptor.com"><strong>BoxCryptor</strong></a> under Windows, there are
some specifig settings to use when you create the EncFS volume. Infact
even if BoxCryptor claims to be "encfs compatible", it's not 100%.</p>
<p>Suppose you want to create an encrypted volume located at
<strong>\$HOME/.TestTmpEncrypted</strong> and mounted at <strong>\$HOME/TestTmp</strong> you need
the following command:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>andrea-Inspiron-660:~ andrea $ encfs ~/.TestTmpEncrypted ~/TestTmp
</pre></div>


<p>answer "Y" when you are asked if you want to create the folders:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>The directory &quot;/home/andrea/.TestTmpEncrypted/&quot; does not exist. Should it be created? (y,n) y
The directory &quot;/home/andrea/TestTmp&quot; does not exist. Should it be created? (y,n) y
</pre></div>


<p>At this point you will need to select between default paranoia mode or
advanced mode. Please choose the <strong>advanced</strong> one (x):</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Creating new encrypted volume.
Please choose from one of the following options:
 enter &quot;x&quot; for expert configuration mode,
 enter &quot;p&quot; for pre-configured paranoia mode,
 anything else, or an empty line will select standard mode.
?&gt; x
</pre></div>


<p>Manual configuration mode selected.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Select AES as cypher algorithm:

The following cypher algorithms are available:
1. AES : 16 byte block cipher
-- Supports key lengths of 128 to 256 bits
-- Supports block sizes of 64 to 4096 bytes
2. Blowfish : 8 byte block cypher
-- Supports key lengths of 128 to 256 bits
-- Supports block sizes of 64 to 4096 bytes

Enter the number corresponding to your choice: 1

Selected algorithm &quot;AES&quot;
</pre></div>


<p>Select <strong>256</strong> as key size:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Please select a key size in bits. The cypher you have chosen
supports sizes from 128 to 256 bits in increments of 64 bits.
For example:
128, 192, 256
Selected key size: 256

Using key size of 256 bits
</pre></div>


<p>Choose <strong>1024</strong> as block size:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Select a block size in bytes. The cypher you have chosen
supports sizes from 64 to 4096 bytes in increments of 16.
Alternatively, just press enter for the default (1024 bytes)

filesystem block size:

Using filesystem block size of 1024 bytes
</pre></div>


<p>Select <strong>Stream</strong> as filename encoding:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>The following filename encoding algorithms are available:
1. Block : Block encoding, hides file name size somewhat
2. Null : No encryption of filenames
3. Stream : Stream encoding, keeps filenames as short as possible

Enter the number corresponding to your choice: 3

Selected algorithm &quot;Stream&quot;&quot;
</pre></div>


<p>Do <strong>NOT</strong> enable <strong>filename initialization vector chaining</strong>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Enable filename initialization vector chaining?
This makes filename encoding dependent on the complete path,
rather then encoding each path element individually.
The default here is Yes.
Any response that does not begin with &#39;n&#39; will mean Yes: no
</pre></div>


<p>Do <strong>NOT</strong> enable <strong>per-file initialization vectors</strong>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Enable per-file initialization vectors?
This adds about 8 bytes per file to the storage requirements.
It should not affect performance except possibly with applications
which rely on block-aligned file io for performance.
The default here is Yes.
Any response that does not begin with &#39;n&#39; will mean Yes: no
</pre></div>


<p>Do <strong>NOT</strong> enable <strong>external chained IV</strong>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>External chained IV disabled, as both &#39;IV chaining&#39;
and &#39;unique IV&#39; features are required for this option.
Enable block authentication code headers
on every block in a file? This adds about 12 bytes per block
to the storage requirements for a file, and significantly affects
performance but it also means [almost] any modifications or errors
within a block will be caught and will cause a read error.
The default here is No.
Any response that does not begin with &#39;y&#39; will mean No: no
</pre></div>


<p>Do <strong>NOT</strong> enable <strong>random bytes to each block header</strong>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Add random bytes to each block header?
This adds a performance penalty, but ensures that blocks
have different authentication codes. Note that you can
have the same benefits by enabling per-file initialisation
vectors, which does not come with as great a performance
penalty.
Select a number of bytes, from 0 (no random bytes) to 8: 0
</pre></div>


<p>Enable <strong>file-hole pass-through</strong>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Enable file-hole pass-through?
This avoids writing encrypted blocks when file holes are created.
The default here is Yes.
Any response that does not begin with &#39;n&#39; will mean Yes: yes
</pre></div>


<p>Finally you will see:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Configuration finished. The filesystem to be created has
the following properties:
Filesystem cypher: &quot;ssl/aes&quot;, version 3:0:2
Filename encoding: &quot;nameio/stream&quot;, version 2:1:2
Key Size: 256 bits
Block Size: 1024 bytes
File holes passed through to ciphertext.
</pre></div>


<p>At this point set a passphrase for your new volume:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Now you will need to enter a password for your filesystem.
You will need to remember this password, as there is absolutely
no recovery mechanism. However, the password can be changed
later using encfsctl.

New Encfs Password:
Verify Encfs Password:
</pre></div>


<p>You should be able to mount this volume using BoxCryptor.</p>

        <span>Tue 02 September 2014</span>
	        <span>| in <a href="https://www.andreagrandi.it/category/howto-linux-raspberrypi.html">HowTo, Linux, RaspberryPi</a></span>

</footer><!-- /.post-info -->                <p>If you want to connect your <strong>RaspberryPi</strong> to your home network and you
want to avoid cables, I suggest you to use the <strong>Edimax wifi adapter</strong>.
This device is quite cheap (around £8 on
<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Edimax-EW-7811UN-150Mbps-Wireless-Adapter/dp/B003MTTJOY/">Amazon</a>)
and it's very easy to configure on Raspbian (I assume you are using a
recent version of Raspbian. I'm using the one released on 20/06/2014).</p>
<p><a href="http://www.andreagrandi.it/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/edimax-pi3.png"><img alt="edimax-pi3" src="http://www.andreagrandi.it/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/edimax-pi3.png">{.aligncenter
.wp-image-895 width="708"
height="398"}</a></p>
<h2>Configure the wifi adapter</h2>
<p>Edit <strong>/etc/network/interfaces</strong> and insert these configuration values:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>auto lo
iface lo inet loopback
iface eth0 inet dhcp

allow-hotplug wlan0
auto wlan0

iface wlan0 inet dhcp
wpa-ssid YOURESSID
wpa-psk YOURWPAPASSWORD
</pre></div>


<h2>Power management issue</h2>
<p>There is a known "issue" with this adapter default configuration that
makes it to turn off if the wlan interface is not in use for some
minutes. To avoid this you have to customize the parameters used to load
the kernel module. First check that your adapter is using <strong>8192cu</strong>
module:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>sudo lsmod | grep 8192
8192cu 551136 0
</pre></div>


<p>Create the file <strong>/etc/modprobe.d/8192cu.conf</strong> and insert the following
lines inside:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span># prevent power down of wireless when idle
options 8192cu rtw_power_mgnt=0 rtw_enusbss=0
</pre></div>


<p>I also suggest to create a little entry in crontab to make the
RaspberryPi ping your router every minute. This will ensure that your
wifi connection will stay alive. To edit crontab just type (from pi
user, you don't need to be root):</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>crontab -e
</pre></div>


<p>and insert this line at the end:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>*/1 * * * * ping -c 1 192.168.0.1
</pre></div>


<p>where 192.168.0.1 is the IP of your router (of course substitute this
value with the ip of your router).</p>
<h3>Keep Alive Script</h3>
<p>I created a further script to keep my WIFI alive. This script will ping
the router (change the IP using the one of your router) every 5 minutes
and if the ping fails it brings down the wlan0 interface, the kernel
module for the wifi and bring them up again.</p>
<p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/andreagrandi/c703e4e67c38fbecf340.js"></script>
</p>

<p>Just put this script in <strong>/root/wifi_recover.sh</strong> and then execute from
<strong>root</strong> user:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>chmod +x wifi_recover.sh
crontab -e
</pre></div>


<p>Insert this line inside the crontab editor:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>*/5 * * * * /root/wifi_recover.sh
</pre></div>


<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The configuration is done. Just reboot your RaspberryPi and enjoy your
wifi connection.</p>

</footer><!-- /.post-info -->                <p>Developing a large web application or before deploying some code is very
important to verify the quality of the code itself, check if we have
introduced any regression or bug and have something that tell us if we
are increasing or decreasing the quality of the code.</p>
<p>Suppose we are in an organization or a company where the basic rule is:
<strong>master</strong> branch is always ready/stable to be deployed. In a team
usually people work on personal branches, then when the code is stable
it's merged with master.</p>
<p>How do we check if the code is stable and ready to be merged? First of
all we need to cover all our code with <strong>proper tests</strong> (I won't go in
details about unit testing here, I assume that the reader knows what I'm
talking about), then we need to actually run them, possibly in an
isolated environment that is similar to the production one, and check if
they all pass. If they do, we are quite safe to merge our code with
master branch.</p>
<p>How can we ensure that all the developers remember to run tests when
they push some new code? To make things a bit more real, let's take the
example of a Python/Django product (or even a library) that currently
supports <strong>Python 2.6, 2.7, 3.3</strong> and <strong>Django 1.4.x, 1.5.x, 1.6.x</strong>.
The whole matrix consists of <strong>9 possible combinations</strong>. Do we have to
manually run tests on 9 configurations? No, we don't.</p>
<h2>Travis-ci.org</h2>
<p><strong>Travis</strong> is a continuous integration tool that, once configured, takes
care of these tasks and let us save lot of time (that we can use to
actually write code). <a href="https://travis-ci.org">Travis-ci.org</a> is an
online service that works with <a href="https://github.com"><strong>GitHub</strong></a> (it
requires we use GitHub as repository for our code), and once we have
connected the two accounts and configured a very simple file in our
projects, it's automatically triggered when we push on our GitHub
repository.</p>
<p>The configuration consists of adding a file named <strong>.travis.yml</strong> in the
root of our project. A working example is available here
<a href="https://github.com/andreagrandi/workshopvenues/blob/master/.travis.yml">https://github.com/andreagrandi/workshopvenues/blob/master/.travis.yml</a>
(all the env variables I set are not required normally, but that's where
I save the values of my configuration, so they need to be initialized
before I can run tests).</p>
<p>The service supports most of the languages that are commonly used and
even a good number of PAAS, making it very easy to automatically
<strong>deploy</strong> our code. If it should not be enough for your needs, they
also expose a public <strong>API</strong>. I suggest you to give a look at the
official documentation that will explain everything in details
<a href="http://docs.travis-ci.com">http://docs.travis-ci.com</a></p>
<p>Once everything is configured, we will have something like this on our
console
<a href="https://travis-ci.org/andreagrandi/workshopvenues/jobs/19882128">https://travis-ci.org/andreagrandi/workshopvenues/jobs/19882128</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.andreagrandi.it/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/travis-ci-console.png"><img alt="travis-ci-console" src="http://www.andreagrandi.it/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/travis-ci-console-1024x544.png">{.aligncenter
.wp-image-832 width="614"
height="326"}</a></p>
<p>If something goes wrong (if tests don't pass for example) we receive a
notification with all the informations about the failing build, and if
we had configured an automatic deployment of course the code would not
be deployed in case of a failing build.</p>
<p>Travis-ci.org is <strong>completly free</strong> for opensource projects and has also
a paid version for private repositories.</p>
<h2 id="coveralls.io" style="text-align: left;">Coveralls.io</h2>
<p>There is a nice tool available for Python called
<a href="http://nedbatchelder.com/code/coverage"><strong>coverage</strong></a>. Basically it
runs tests and checks the percentage of the source code that is covered
by tests, producing a nice report that shows us the percentage for every
single file/module and even the lines of code that have been tested.</p>
<p>Thanks to Coveralls.io and the use of Travis, even these tasks are
completly automatized and the results are available online like in this
example <a href="https://coveralls.io/builds/560853">https://coveralls.io/builds/560853</a></p>
<p>The configuration is quite easy. We need to connect our Coveralls.io
profile with GitHub, like we did for Travis-ci.org and then enable the
repository. To trigger Coveralls after a successful Travis build, we
need to have these lines at the end of our <strong>.travis.yml</strong> file</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>after_success:
  - coveralls
</pre></div>


<p><a href="http://www.andreagrandi.it/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/coveralls-console.png"><img alt="coveralls-console" src="http://www.andreagrandi.it/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/coveralls-console-1024x767.png">{.aligncenter
.wp-image-836 width="614"
height="460"}</a><br>
Even Coveralls.io is <strong>completly free</strong> for opensource projects and
offers a paid version for private repositories.</p>
<h2>Heroku</h2>
<p>I use <a href="https://www.heroku.com"><strong>Heroku</strong></a> to host and run my web
application. Normally to deploy on Heroku you so something like this:
<strong>git push heroku master</strong></p>
<p>Adding these settings to the <strong>.travis.yaml</strong> file, I can automatically
deploy the application on Heroku, if the build was successful:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">deploy</span><span class="o">:</span>
  <span class="n">provider</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">heroku</span>
  <span class="n">api_key</span><span class="o">:</span>

  <span class="n">app</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">workshopvenues</span>
  <span class="n">on</span><span class="o">:</span>
    <span class="n">repo</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">andreagrandi</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">workshopvenues</span>
  <span class="n">run</span><span class="o">:</span>
    <span class="o">-</span> <span class="s2">&quot;python workshopvenues/manage.py syncdb&quot;</span>
    <span class="o">-</span> <span class="s2">&quot;python workshopvenues/manage.py migrate&quot;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Not only the code is deployed, after deployment the <strong>South migrations</strong>
are executed.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>These two tools are saving me lot of time and are ensuring that the code
I release for a project I'm working on
(<a href="https://github.com/andreagrandi/workshopvenues"><strong>WorkshopVenues</strong></a>)
is always tested when I push it on my repository.</p>
