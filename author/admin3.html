</footer><!-- /.post-info -->                <p>To understand how a <strong><a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/topics/http/middleware/">Django
Middleware</a></strong>
works we need to remember that the basic architecture of Django is
composed by a <strong>request</strong> and a <strong>response</strong>. A middleware is something
that stays in the middle. Let's give a look to the next diagram, taken
from official Django documentation:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.andreagrandi.it/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/middleware.png"><img alt="middleware" src="https://www.andreagrandi.it/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/middleware.png">{.aligncenter
.size-full .wp-image-1012 width="601"
height="511"}</a></p>
<h2>Important things to know</h2>
<p>There are four important things to know about middlewares:</p>
<ul>
<li>You need to write a class that just inherit from <strong><em>object</em></strong></li>
<li>The <strong>order</strong> where you place your middleware in <strong>settings.py</strong> is
    important: middlewares are processed from top to bottom during a
    request and from bottom to top during a response.</li>
<li>You don't need to implement all the available methods of a
    middleware. For example you can just implement <strong>process_request</strong>
    and <strong>process_template_response</strong></li>
<li>If you implement <strong>process_request</strong> and you decide to return an
    <strong>HttpResponse</strong>, all the other middlewares, views etc... will be
    ignored and only your response will be returned</li>
</ul>
<h2>Writing a middleware</h2>
<p>In my example I wanted to implement a feature that saves the time when a
request is made and the time when a request has been processed, then
calculates the time delta and exposes this value in the context so that
is accessible from our templates. How to implement a similar feature
using a middleware? Here is my example:</p>
<p>``` {.lang:python .decode:true}
from datetime import datetime</p>
<p>class BenchmarkMiddleware(object):
    def process_request(self, request):
        request._request_time = datetime.now()</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>def process_template_response(self, request, response):
    response_time = request._request_time - datetime.now()
    response.context_data[&#39;response_time&#39;] = abs(response_time)
    return response
</pre></div>


<p>```</p>
<p>Please don't care about how I calculated the time. I'm aware that there
are better ways to do it, but I just wanted to keep it simple and show
how to implement a simple middleware.</p>
<p>If you want to see a <strong>complete example</strong> of a project that includes and
uses this middleware, here you can find the complete source
code: <a href="https://github.com/andreagrandi/benchmark-middleware-example">https://github.com/andreagrandi/benchmark-middleware-example</a></p>

</footer><!-- /.post-info -->                <p>I must admit it, there was a time when I was not using <strong>HTTPS</strong>, not
even to protect the admin section of the website. This means that anyone
could have intercepted the password and published (or deleted) things in
my name. Since a couple of years ago I started protecting my admin
sectio using an SSL certificate.  I haven't done it before for a couple
of reason: my hosting was on a provider that required a lot of money
(something like 100\$/year) to enable SSL support, plus an SSL
certificated costed at least 100-120\$/year.</p>
<p>When I migrated my website on my own <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=cc8349e328a5">VPS on
DigitalOcean</a> I
finally discovered that <strong><a href="https://www.startssl.com">StartSSL</a></strong> was
giving <strong>free class 1 certificates</strong> and I immediately got one. I made
the mistake to just serve the admin pages using HTTPS, not all the
website. I regretted about this decision after readin a
<a href="http://dannyman.toldme.com/2010/12/23/swa-yahoo-being-evil/">couple</a> of
<a href="http://opensource.com/business/15/8/interview-daniel-roesler-utilityapi">articles</a>
that were explaining how some internet providers where changing served
HTTP pages injecting their own ads or banner. That was unacceptable to
me and I swicthed the whole website to HTTPS.</p>
<p>Basically, if you don't serve even your personal website using HTTPS,
someone could change the page while it's being transfered to the
requester. Imagine if you have (like me) a page on your blog that let
people download your public PGP key. Users could be served with a
different key, so someone else would be able to decrypt a message
intended for you only. Scary, isn't it?</p>
<p>If you need more informations about how to request a StartSSL
certificate and how to install it on Nginx/Apache, I can suggest this
nice tutorial: <a href="https://konklone.com/post/switch-to-https-now-for-free">https://konklone.com/post/switch-to-https-now-for-free</a></p>
<p>If you need to serve a WordPress website, that configuration is not
enough. In that case you may want to have a look at my own Nginx
configuration, available at this
address: <a href="https://gist.github.com/andreagrandi/5de9dc9c4eb7e732764c">https://gist.github.com/andreagrandi/5de9dc9c4eb7e732764c</a></p>

</footer><!-- /.post-info -->                <p>This won't be a full post, but just a quick note (probably the first one
of a serie) about development with Django.</p>
<p>When we write a <strong>TestCase</strong> test, if we have defined a <strong>setUp</strong>
method, it will be called before the execution of each test. One could
think that the database is completely reset after each test, but this is
not true (not like I was thinking). After each test, whatever we wrote
on the database is rolled back. If we create a "Client" row (assuming we
have a model called Clients) in our setUp, when we call it the second
time the ID won't be 1 as someone (me included) could expect. It will be
2 instead, because the database has not completely deleted and created
from scratch.</p>
<p>This means that we can't assume that our Client ID will always be 1 for
each test and we should rather reference to it in a dinamic way like:
<strong>self.client.id</strong></p>
<p>This could be a trivial thing for many people but I was not 100% sure
about this so I asked for a confirmation on <strong>#django</strong> IRC room and
people (expecially <strong>apollo13</strong>) was kind enough to explain me how it
works.</p>

</footer><!-- /.post-info -->                <p>I'm a big fan of <a href="http://somafm.com">Soma.fm</a> (a 25+ channels streaming
radio based in San Francisco) and during the years I've been writing
clients for this radio for different mobile platforms (Maemo, MeeGo,
Harmattan, Windows Phone, BlackBerry 10, Jolla). I love in particular
their "<a href="http://somafm.com/indiepop/"><strong>Indie Pop Rock</strong></a>" channel that
during these years made me discover some very good artists.</p>
<p>When <strong>Spotify</strong> finally was available in Italy (I'm still using it
right now that I live in the UK), something that I always missed was a
radio with the same good music. Why not just listening to Soma.fm?
Because I like to listen to the music while I commute and in the London
Underground it's nearly impossible to have signal.</p>
<p>So I was thinking: it would be nice to have <strong>a Spotify playlist with
Soma.fm tracks</strong>. Wait a moment.... <strong>I can do it!</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.andreagrandi.it/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Frankenstein_Jr_Mel_Brooks_1974.jpg"><img alt="Frankenstein_Jr_Mel_Brooks_1974" src="https://www.andreagrandi.it/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Frankenstein_Jr_Mel_Brooks_1974.jpg">{.aligncenter
.size-full .wp-image-981 width="542"
height="422"}</a></p>
<p>Soma.fm publishes the tracks history with all the tracks streamed during
the last hour <a href="http://somafm.com/indiepop/songhistory.html">http://somafm.com/indiepop/songhistory.html</a> so I just
needed something to parse this list for me and return me a well
formatted version.</p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="https://import.io"><strong>import.io</strong></a> (it's a service that takes
a web page as input, parse the data and generates a RESTful API to
access this data) I was able to easily get the data I needed. At this
point I only needed to be able to loop through the list, search each
track on Spotify and add it to my playlist.</p>
<p>The <strong>source code is fully available</strong> here
<a href="https://github.com/andreagrandi/spotisoma">https://github.com/andreagrandi/spotisoma</a></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> you can't just get the code and run it. You will need to get
your own <strong>import.io api key</strong>, generate your import.io api url, get a
<a href="https://developer.spotify.com/technologies/libspotify/keys/"><strong>Spotify application
key</strong></a> (the
old/deprecated one, since it was nearly impossible for me to use oauth
in a simple Python script due to the fact I didn't have an endpoint to
receive the token back. You can get more informations here:
<a href="https://pyspotify.mopidy.com/en/latest/quickstart/#application-keys">https://pyspotify.mopidy.com/en/latest/quickstart/#application-keys</a>)
and set your env variables with your Spotify username and password. Last
but not least: the <strong>old Spotify library</strong> only works with <strong>Premium</strong>
accounts.</p>
