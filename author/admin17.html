</footer><!-- /.post-info -->                <p>Few days ago I published <a href="http://www.andreagrandi.it/2010/02/17/nokia-n900-some-problems-with-latest-pr-1-1-1-firmware/">some
notes</a>
about my personal experience with <strong>PR 1.1.1</strong> firmware upgrade in Nokia
<strong>N900</strong>. In particular my device got an infinite reboot loop after
upgrading the firmware and I had to flash the firmware image from
scratch to fix the problem. Today I was kindly contacted by <strong>Max
Waterman</strong> (I suppose he works for Nokia) and he explained me what was
the problem. It was caused by a little bug in Harmattan UI demo and they
fixed it (the fix is already available in extras-devel).</p>
<p>No surprise for me: extras-devel contains unstable packages and if user
enables it, he does at his own risk. The most important thing is the
fact that the official firmware without any unstable application doesn't
suffer of this problem at all. The thing that really impressed me so
much (in a positive sense) it's that I was contacted privately by a
Nokia developer apologizing for the bug (no problem man, it's part of
the game if someone want to test extras-devel software) and explaining
that they already fixed it.</p>
<p>This is what I like of Maemo (or should I already call it MeeGo?), I
really feel to be a part of it!</p>

</footer><!-- /.post-info -->                <p>I don't know if it's just a case or if I'm the only one who had these
problems, but I'll report them anyway, maybe somebody had my same
problem and we could try to prepare a proper bug report to make the
Maemo team fix them.</p>
<h2>Infinite boot loop after upgrade</h2>
<p>First of all I have to say that before upgrading to PR 1.1.1 I checked
if I had enough space on the rootfs. I only had 27 Mb and so I decided
to remove some unused applications, deleted some *.deb in
/var/cache/apt/archives and disabled extras repositories. Of course I
also did a backup of all my configuration. After the cleaning operation
I had near 60 Mb free on rootfs, enough to install the upgrade.</p>
<p>I closed all running applications, started the application manager and
began the upgrade. After the upgrade was completed, the device did a
reboot... then another one, then again, again.... until I had to remove
the battery to stop it.</p>
<p>Conclusion: I had to re-flash the device with the latest image to make
it work again.</p>
<h2>mafw-dbus-wrapper taking all the CPU</h2>
<p>I was watching a video (using subtitles) and after some minutes the
whole UI became unresponsive. Strange because I already did this before
without having any problem. I tried to check the problem using "top"
utility from terminal and I saw that there was a mafw process
(mafw-dbus-wrapper) that was taking 80-90% of CPU. My fault is that
normally there are at least 3-4 , mafw-dbus-wrapper processes and I
didn't check which one was causing the problem. Anyway I made a
screenshot, just in case it can help.</p>

<p>I hope this short report can be useful to help Maemo team to fix or at
least investigate what happened. Just leave a comment or contact me if
you need more informations.</p>

</footer><!-- /.post-info -->                <h2>Introduction</h2>
<p><img alt="" src="http://www.andreagrandi.it/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/fon-300x294.jpg" title="fon">{.alignright
.size-medium .wp-image-336 width="168" height="164"}As many of you
already know, <strong>Fon</strong> is a spanish company that some years ago had the
interesting idea of creating a <strong>wifi community</strong> to share the Internet
connection. The idea is quite simple: each "fonero" buy a Fonera (the
router sold by Fon), register it on the Fon system and get a
username/password. If the fonero travels around the world he's able to
connect to wifi signal of other foneras and browse the web for free.</p>
<p>When I bought my first fonera few years ago, I was one of the first
people in my city. I bought it because I was really beliving in this
project. During these years Fon produced new models of fonera and I
bought each of them (the WRT54 router, Fonera, Fonera+, Fonera 2.0g,
Fonera 2.0n ecc....). Since first year, the Fon community has grown a
lot and now there are a lot of foneros around the world.</p>
<h2>Actual situation</h2>
<p>Few months ago Fon launched a very interesting product: <strong>Fonera 2.0g</strong>.
Thats's not only a router. Fonera 2 is capable of managing torrents,
rapidshare downloads, uploading photo on Facebook and Flickr, and much
more. Whats's wrong with this product? It's <strong>very unstable</strong>! There are
a lot of users that bought this router when it was anounced and they're
still waiting for a lot of bugs to be fixed by Fon developers team
(composed by only ONE person!). Why users had to wait so long?</p>
<p>Simple! They were working to Fonera 2.0n! Wow! Faster router, more RAM,
4 ethernet port, wonderful! But... another very unstable router! And
with unstable I mean: it <strong>disconnects/reboots often</strong>, connection is
unstable, applications don't work ecc.... I'm talking about a 79€
router, not about something that users had as preview product. Me and
other users were still waiting for an uograde when... Fon <a href="http://english.martinvarsavsky.net/general/fon-to-unveil-new-fonera-at-mobile-world-congress.html">announced a
new
product</a>!
Yes, another one!</p>
<p>Fon priority is not to fix a product that thousand of users have already
bought. Fon priority is to produce and sell a new product!</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>It could be only my opinion, but I don't trust you anymore Fon! I'm
really disappointed about your behaviour you had with your customers.
I've already spent (wasted) a lot of money with your not-working
products and I'm not going to buy your products anymore! I'm tired of
being illuded by your promises: how long are you going to play tricks on
users?</p>
