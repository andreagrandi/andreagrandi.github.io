</footer><!-- /.post-info -->                <p>When last week <a href="http://fridge.ubuntu.com/2013/02/26/ubuntu-developer-summits-now-online-and-every-three-months/">Canonical
announced</a>
the usual UDS was not going to happen I was a bit shocked and
disappointed: starting from the next UDS (that is going to happen
tomorrow!) the event will be <strong>online only</strong> and <strong>every 3 months</strong>.
During these days I've been thinking a lot about this move and I will
tell you what are the pros and cons, in my opinion, followed by some
final thoughts.</p>
<h2>Pros</h2>
<p>Having 4 UDS every year, instead of 2, is surely a better thing. I'm a
big fan of Scrum methodology, so I think that <strong>iterating more often is
better</strong> than iterating less. If there are any mistakes you can correct
them and iterating again before releasing the final product.</p>
<p>Potentially <strong>more people can partecipate</strong> to the event (even the
opposite is true and I will explain why). People won't need to move from
home, travel, pay any expense etc... they just need a computer and a
good Internet connection.</p>
<p>It's <strong>cheaper for everyone</strong>: I can just imagine how expensive could be
for Canonical to organize a similar event. Booking a big hotel, paying
travel and expenses to near one houndred of community people. People who
didn't get any sponsorization had to pay all the travel expenses to
attend the event.</p>
<h2>Cons</h2>
<p>Potentially <strong>less people can partecipate</strong> to the event. Yes, like I
said before even this sentence is true and I will explain why. First of
all, using Google+ there are at least three countries that will be cut
out: <strong>China</strong>, <strong>Thailand</strong> and <strong>Vietnam</strong>. Google+ is not available
in those countries.</p>
<p>Are you sure that special people will be able to follow the event? For
example <strong>blind people</strong> won't be able to chat or to ask question in the
chat.</p>
<p><strong>Only 10 people</strong> will be able to talk. In normal UDS sessions more
people could raise the hand and ask a question or interact with the
track leaders. Who will choose the 10 people with audio+video streaming
rights?</p>
<p>We will <strong>completly miss the social aspect</strong> of the UDS. If you think
this was only a secondary part, please go on. I felt more committed to
work and collaborate with people I met in person than with someone I've
never met before.</p>
<p>Announcing an event, even if online, just <strong>one week before</strong> it
happens. Really? Some people had already taken vacation from work,
booked flights etc... not counting many people that can't take 2 days
off from work just with 1 week notice period. It's also almost
impossible that community members have the time to schedule a blueprint
and be able to discuss about a subject.</p>
<h2>Final thoughts</h2>
<p>From a <strong>cutting costs</strong> point of view I really can't say anything.
Organizing UDS was surely very expensive for Canonical and nobody can
blame them if they decided to spend those money in a different way.</p>
<p>What really concerns me: is UDS still useful? My opinion is that at
least since latest 2 or 3 UDS the presence of the Community was not so
relevant, because I had <strong>the clear sensation that the most important
decisions were made by Canonical before the UDS</strong> and then there was
just some details tuning. Another proof of my thoughts is the today
announcement: <strong>despite the fact that I 100% agree with Unity switching
to Qt/QML</strong> (I already proposed this 2 years ago during Budapest UDS,
but nobody listened to me) <strong>I completly disagree with the way the
decision was made</strong>: not a single involvement or discussion with the
community.</p>
<p>I would apreaciate <strong>more openness and honesty</strong> from Canonical. Do you
want to take all the decisions? That's fine, but at least state it
clearly.</p>

</footer><!-- /.post-info -->                <p>Developing CuteSoma and maintaining it for three different platforms
(Nokia N9, Windows Phone, BlackBerry 10) is really taking me a lot of
time. I've many features in mind to add but I can't dedicate much spare
time to them and to do it I should take time from other paid projects.
I've also discarded the idea to make CuteSoma a paid app, because it's
been always free (except the Windows Phone one that was non-free for
just a month, but only 6 people "SIX" bought the app).</p>
<p>So I decided to open a <a href="http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/cutesoma-soma-fm-client/x/2353169">fundraising
campaign</a>
on
<a href="http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/cutesoma-soma-fm-client/x/2353169"><strong>Indiegogo</strong></a>
that is a service like <strong>KickStarter</strong>, but it's available all around
the world (not just in USA and UK like Kickstarter).</p>
<h3>What do I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I would like to raise at least <strong>5.000€</strong> to be able to keep maintaining
the existing features and to implement new one. Developing for 3
different platforms really takes a lot of time. I also need to find a
way to get a Windows Phone 8 device because at the moment I cannot test
some features using just the emulator.</p>
<p>What the application currently does:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can view the list of Soma.fm channels</li>
<li>You can listen any channel</li>
</ul>
<p>Features I would like to add:</p>
<ul>
<li>Scrobbling song to Last.fm</li>
<li>Write a new MediaSource for Windows Phone (the default one is quite
    bugged and I need to implement one from scratch)</li>
<li>Port the BlackBerry10 version to the native CascadesUI</li>
</ul>
<div>

### The Impact

Funding the development of CuteSoma you will make thousands of people
really happy, because they will be able to listen to Soma.fm on their
Nokia N9, Windows Phone and BlackBerry 10 devices. You will also make me
feel apreciated for all the hours I'm spending to write the code :)

</div>

<div>

### Completly Opensource

Yes. CuteSoma is completly **opensource**. I keep my source code on
GitHub and BitBucket and it's always updated. All the CuteSoma versions
are released under the **GPL license**.

</footer><!-- /.post-info -->                <p>This morning when I started my Windows Phone 8 emulator to test an
application, the emulator refused to work, giving me this error "<strong>The
Windows Phone Emulator wasn’t able to connect to the Windows Phone
operating system</strong>". Luckly it's very easy to fix. It's caused by the
virtual network interface that has been disabled for some reason
(well... in my case it must depend on the other day when I tryed to
trick WP7 firmware upgrade and used the disconnect trick, but this is
another story).</p>
<p>I searched on Google for a solution and I landed on this
page <a href="http://pauliom.com/2012/12/20/the-windows-phone-emulator-wasnt-able-to-connect-to-the-windows-phone-operating-system/">http://pauliom.com/2012/12/20/the-windows-phone-emulator-wasnt-able-to-connect-to-the-windows-phone-operating-system/</a></p>
<p>All you have to do is going to "<strong>Network and Internet --&gt; Network
Connections</strong>", right click on "<strong>vEthernet (Internal Ethernet Port)
Windows Phone Emulator</strong>" and <strong>Enable</strong> it.</p>
