day at UDS started a bit late for me, since i woke up pretty sick (damn
air conditioned!!!). I did not follow any conferences in the morning. I
relly wanted to follow the <strong>Wayland</strong> one, but when I arrived the room
was already full and it was almost impossible to enter, so I decided not
to enter.</p>
<p>I attended "<strong>What's wrong with UDS and how we can fix it</strong>" session
before having lunch. We discussed the possibility to improve all the
session in general,Â for example giving them a proper order so that a
team can first discuss some API interface, then another team can discuss
how to design them.</p>
<p>We had another wonderful and tasty <strong>lunch</strong>, even if I didn't eat so
much, but food was very good anyway.</p>
<p>During the afternoon I followed an interesting track: "<strong>Recommend music
based on current song playing or on users media library</strong>". We discussed
the possibilities to implement a music suggestion service, based on
user's tastes.</p>
<p>I spent the rest of theconference time writing these blog posts and
uploading pictures.</p>
<p>After the sessions we had the <strong>Linaro Showcase</strong>: lot of demo running
on Linaro and ARM processors. I was really impressed by a robot with
Kinect that was able to follow people recognizing their faces. During
the showcase there was a very nice dinner.</p>
<p>After dinner I went out with my friend <strong>Manrique Lopez</strong> who is here in
Budapest for another conference, so we decided to meet for a good beer.</p>
<p>Before coming back to the hotel me, <strong>Marco Trevisan</strong> and <strong>Andrea
Azzarone</strong> had a nice talk with <strong>Jorge Castro</strong>. He really make us feel
part of the Ubuntu family!</p>

day started at 7:30 with a <strong>very nice breakfast!</strong> I was alone with
just another guy this morning, in a very big breakbast room.</p>
<p>After it I grabbed my badge to avoid queue later and went back to my
room to wake up <strong>Marco Trevisan</strong> (he was still sleeping :P ).</p>
<p>The keynote was opened by <strong>Jono Bacon</strong> (the Ubuntu Community manager),
followed by Ubuntu founder <strong>Mark Shuttleworth</strong>. The most interesting
(and tweeted) part of the keynote was "<strong>how to prounounce Oneiric</strong>"
(Oeniric will be the next Ubuntu release).</p>
<p>The keynote finished with a bit late, so all the other tracks were
shifted forward. I followed "<strong>Unity 2D Oneiric Improvements</strong>", it was
interesting because there were some <strong>Nokia/Qt</strong> guys and they looked
very interested in helping the Unity 2D team and collaborating with
them.</p>
<p>Now following "<strong><a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DocumentationTeam/SystemDocumentation/Tasks/Oneiric">Shaping a strategy for Ubuntu user
assistance</a></strong>",
I just had the possibility my involvement into helping people that
require Ubuntu assistance.</p>
<p>The <strong>lunch</strong> has been very tasty, I had the possibility to eat some
local recipes, not bad at all.</p>
<p>After lunch we had a short session on <strong>Qt</strong>. The version 4.8 is going
to be released in a couple of months, while 5.0 is announced to be
released in 1 year from now: it will be almost code-compatible with 4.x,
it will have an improved support for Qt Quick and QML.</p>
<p>As last track of the day I decided to follow "<strong>Personal Cloud</strong>". Not a
perfect track, since the person who should have been here was only
talking with us using Skype and it was more difficoult to hear what he
said.</p>
<p>At the end of this day there was the "<strong>Meet &amp; Greet</strong>" party, sponsored
by Freescale and Openstack. They offered a dinner and we had some good
music after it.</p>

left from <strong>Firenze</strong> with my friend <strong>Marco Trevisan</strong>, to go to
<strong><a href="http://uds.ubuntu.com">Ubuntu Developer Summit</a></strong> in <strong>Budapest</strong>. We
changed flight in <strong>Rome</strong> where we met also <strong>Andrea Azzarone</strong>.
Unluckly <strong>Alitalia losts Marco's baggage</strong>, so he's still waiting for
it.</p>
<p>We arrived at the hotel at 20:00 more or less where we met other people
of the community. There are <strong>lot of italians</strong> at UDS. Most work for
Canonical, other were sponsored by.</p>
<p>I met <strong>Marianna Raffaele</strong> (one of the UDS organizer... yeah, she's
italian too!), I had to explain her a little problem I had with my
booking (nothing bad) and she managed to help me. She also gave me a
very nice guitar plettre with Ubuntu logo. Thank you Marianna for this!</p>
<p>We went out with <strong>Jorge Castro</strong> to drink some beers (he offered me
one, thanks Jorge!!!) and we met lot of other Ubuntu people. A really
amazing start!</p>

.size-medium .wp-image-481
width="200"}</a>Few
days ago I received an email fromÂ <strong>Jorge O. Castro</strong> of the Ubuntu
Community, announcing me that my request of sponsorization for <strong><a href="http://uds.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu
Developer Summit</a></strong> has been accepted. I have
never attended an UDS before, so I must admit I feel a bit disoriented
at the moment and maybe I'm missing some important informations, but at
least I'm a good test for the situation of a community member
approaching it for the first time.Â Since I would like to actively help
the organization of the Summit, I started looking for the right place to
do it. I've a good experience about events organization and during these
years I helped, for example, in the organization of <strong>Maemo Summit</strong> and
<strong>MeeGo Conference</strong>, so I'd like to share my experience with the Ubuntu
Community too.</p>
<h3>USD Website</h3>
<p>The Ubuntu Developer Summit website isÂ <a href="http://uds.ubuntu.com/">http://uds.ubuntu.com/</a>. It
looks nice at first view, but it's missing a lot of important
informations and it contains some errors. The
<a href="http://uds.ubuntu.com/travel/">Travel</a> section, for example should
beÂ named "Travel and Accomodation" and should contains not only
information about the main hotel where the Summit will take place, but
also useful informations about cheap hotels/hostels for Community people
who are not sponsored. The <a href="http://uds.ubuntu.com/tracks/">Tracks</a>
section is still empty. Is it possible that when less than 1 month is
missing, official tracks are not available yet? I don't mean categories,
I mean tracks inside them. The Schedule is still empty too. Clicking any
track take to a page containing an error: I would like to submit this
bug, but where? Even worse, clicking on Schedule takes the visitor to a
different website and there is no ways to navigate back (except clicking
the back button on browser).</p>
<h3>Forum</h3>
<p>I wasn't able to find any section in the <a href="http://ubuntuforums.org/">official Ubuntu
forum</a> where to talk about Ubuntu Developer
Summit. I think it would be useful to have a dedicated section to talk
about UDS or about generic Ubuntu related events. It would be useful for
people to be able to meet/know each other before attending. I was lucky
to meet Marco Trevisan, from the Ubuntu Italian Community, so we will
travel together (thanks to a Twitter message I sent!).</p>
<h3>IRC</h3>
<p>The <strong>#ubuntu-uds</strong> channel on <strong>FreeNode</strong> is not much populated and a
couple of times I visited it nobody wrote anything. We should keep at
least 2-3 people, in turns, always available to answer any question
about UDS, it would be easier for people to find the informations they
look for.</p>
<h3>Wiki</h3>
<p>It would be nice to have a page on the wiki to organize better the
event. We could write a list of tasks to do and each Community member
could pick one and help with it. In this way we could divide the jobs. I
know there is a lot to do when we organize these kind of events and the
help of the Community is something we cannot risk to miss.</p>
<h3>Media</h3>
<p>We should give some informations to people who will attend UDS to be
sure they will use proper tags when they will publish pictures, tweets,
blog entries ecc... Do we have a tag to use on Flickr? What is the right
tag to use on Twitter? What keywords should we use when we will blog
about the Summit? All these informations are important if we want to be
sure other people will find our posts in an easy way.</p>
<h3>Mailing List</h3>
<p>Ubuntu has a lot of <a href="https://lists.ubuntu.com/">mailing lists</a>, but it
looks like none dedicated to events discussion. There is one called
<a href="https://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/Ubuntu-event-planners">ubuntu-events-planners</a>
but nobody is using it since months ago. We should use a mailing list to
discuss about events organization and/or create a dedicated one for UDS.</p>
