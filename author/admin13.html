<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Even if it's not a new model, the <strong>HTC Desire</strong> is still a very good
Android device, thanks to its <strong>1Ghz</strong> CPU and <strong>512 Mb RAM</strong>, but one
of the biggest problems of this phone is that it comes with <strong>only
148Mb</strong> available in the ROM. Once the operating system is installed
(ROM I mean), after installing few useful applications you'll end the
available space very soon. There are many apps available, like App2SD
that move your applications to the SD card, but it's not enough because
only the application is moved, not the data. To move the data to the SD
card, there is a very nice utility called <strong>Data2SD</strong>. Please note that
this procedure requires you to reflash your device and partition your SD
card, so <strong>please do a complete backup</strong> before proceding.</p>
<h2>What you need</h2>
<ul>
<li>a <strong>rooted</strong> HTC Desire (you need to have a rooted phone with a
    <strong>recovery</strong> already installed)</li>
<li>a <strong>4Gb</strong> (or bigger) <strong>microSD</strong>, at least <strong>class 4</strong> (class 6 is
    even better while class 10 is reported not working with this phone)</li>
<li>a <strong>microSD</strong> card <strong>reader</strong></li>
<li><strong>CyanogenMod
    7</strong>: http://download.cyanogenmod.com/get/update-cm-7.0.3-Desire-signed.zip</li>
<li><strong>Data2SD</strong>: <a href="http://www.droidzone.in/roms/index.php?dir=StarBurst%2Fdata2sd%2F&amp;download=Data2SDInstallerX1.zip">Data2SDInstallerX1.zip</a>
    and
    <a href="http://www.droidzone.in/roms/index.php?dir=StarBurst%2Fdata2sd%2F&amp;download=Data2SDReInstallerX1.zip">Data2SDReInstallerX1.zip</a></li>
<li><strong>Google
    Apps</strong>: <a href="http://wiki.cyanogenmod.com/wiki/Latest_Version#Google_Apps">http://wiki.cyanogenmod.com/wiki/Latest_Version#Google_Apps</a></li>
<li><strong>GParted</strong>: you can use the version available on Ubuntu Linux or
    you can download a live Linux image with GParted
    installed: <a href="http://gparted.sourceforge.net/livecd.php">http://gparted.sourceforge.net/livecd.php</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Procedure</h2>
<h3>Backup your data</h3>
<div>

Before following these instructions, please **do a complete backup** of
your microSD, of your original ROM (using Nandroid or similar) ecc...

</div>

<h3>Prepare the microSD card</h3>
<div>

-   Open GParted on your Ubuntu Linux or use the GParted Live CD/USB.
-   Delete all partitions on this microSD
-   Create the first one using FAT32 filesystem, leaving 2Gb
    (**2047Mb**) available at the end.
-   Create a second partition using **ext4** filesystem.
-   Confirm your changes
-   Copy CyanogenMod7 rom, Data2SD installers and Google Apps on FAT32
    partition

</div>

<h3>CyanogenMod 7 installation</h3>
<div>

-   Reboot your phone into **Recovery** (turn it off then press volume
    down + power)
-   **WIPE** all data (userdata, cache ecc...)
-   Choose "Install from SD card" and select CyanogenMod7 installation
    zip
-   when finished reboot your phone
-   Enter your Wifi settings, language ecc.... **DO NOT enter** your
    Google account settings.
-   reboot your phone

### Data2SD installation

</div>

<div>

-   Boot into **Recovery** again
-   Choose "Install from SD card" and select **Data2SDInstallerX1.zip**
    (please note, you may have to **turn off the signature
    verification** in Other-&gt;Turn off ecc...)
-   when finished reboot your phone
-   now you should see **1,97Gb** if you go in
    Settings-&gt;Storage-&gt;Internal Storage-&gt;Total space

### Google Apps installation

</div>

<div>

-   Reboot your phone into Recovery
-   Choose "Install from SD card" and select the Google Apps zip file

this morning I didn't wake up early because I still felt sick (I already
know this sore throath won't abandon me untile I go back home).</p>
<p>I had a <strong>light breakfast at 10:30</strong> and then I finishes uploading some
pictures and published articles on my blog I already had written before.</p>
<p>While waiting to attend a session, I found <strong>Mark Shuttleworth</strong> around
and I congratulated with him for the effort he is putting into Ubuntu.
Without a similar distribution, I'm pretty sure that Linux would not be
so popular today.</p>
<p>We had lunch at 13:00 as usual and after that I attended a couple of
presentation. The first one on Eucalyptus, then "<strong>Cooking Recipes</strong>"
for Ubuntu and another one dedicated to <strong>Wine</strong>. The Wine session was
so funny! They had a little problem with video projector and all the
images appeared with a blur effect so that you could think to be drunk
;)</p>
<p>After these sessions I had to go back to my room since I didn't feel
very well, but I was able to attend "<strong>Unity's relations and
dependancies on GNOME</strong>" thanks to audio streaming, IRC for asking
questions and etherpad to take notes.</p>
<p>I attended also "<strong>desktop-dx-o-unity-a11y</strong>" where there was a
discussion about the state of <strong>Unity</strong> and what can be improved before
<strong>Oneiric</strong> release. Lot of work has to be done yet, in particular about
accessibility.</p>
<p>Last session of this day, a
<strong><a href="http://summit.ubuntu.com/uds-o/meeting/other-o-sabdfl-community-qa/">Q+A</a></strong>
with <strong>Mark Shuttleworth</strong>. The session was very interesting! He replied
to all questions coming from the public and from IRC.</p>

day at UDS started a bit late for me, since i woke up pretty sick (damn
air conditioned!!!). I did not follow any conferences in the morning. I
relly wanted to follow the <strong>Wayland</strong> one, but when I arrived the room
was already full and it was almost impossible to enter, so I decided not
to enter.</p>
<p>I attended "<strong>What's wrong with UDS and how we can fix it</strong>" session
before having lunch. We discussed the possibility to improve all the
session in general, for example giving them a proper order so that a
team can first discuss some API interface, then another team can discuss
how to design them.</p>
<p>We had another wonderful and tasty <strong>lunch</strong>, even if I didn't eat so
much, but food was very good anyway.</p>
<p>During the afternoon I followed an interesting track: "<strong>Recommend music
based on current song playing or on users media library</strong>". We discussed
the possibilities to implement a music suggestion service, based on
user's tastes.</p>
<p>I spent the rest of theconference time writing these blog posts and
uploading pictures.</p>
<p>After the sessions we had the <strong>Linaro Showcase</strong>: lot of demo running
on Linaro and ARM processors. I was really impressed by a robot with
Kinect that was able to follow people recognizing their faces. During
the showcase there was a very nice dinner.</p>
<p>After dinner I went out with my friend <strong>Manrique Lopez</strong> who is here in
Budapest for another conference, so we decided to meet for a good beer.</p>
<p>Before coming back to the hotel me, <strong>Marco Trevisan</strong> and <strong>Andrea
Azzarone</strong> had a nice talk with <strong>Jorge Castro</strong>. He really make us feel
part of the Ubuntu family!</p>

day started at 7:30 with a <strong>very nice breakfast!</strong> I was alone with
just another guy this morning, in a very big breakbast room.</p>
<p>After it I grabbed my badge to avoid queue later and went back to my
room to wake up <strong>Marco Trevisan</strong> (he was still sleeping :P ).</p>
<p>The keynote was opened by <strong>Jono Bacon</strong> (the Ubuntu Community manager),
followed by Ubuntu founder <strong>Mark Shuttleworth</strong>. The most interesting
(and tweeted) part of the keynote was "<strong>how to prounounce Oneiric</strong>"
(Oeniric will be the next Ubuntu release).</p>
<p>The keynote finished with a bit late, so all the other tracks were
shifted forward. I followed "<strong>Unity 2D Oneiric Improvements</strong>", it was
interesting because there were some <strong>Nokia/Qt</strong> guys and they looked
very interested in helping the Unity 2D team and collaborating with
them.</p>
<p>Now following "<strong><a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DocumentationTeam/SystemDocumentation/Tasks/Oneiric">Shaping a strategy for Ubuntu user
assistance</a></strong>",
I just had the possibility my involvement into helping people that
require Ubuntu assistance.</p>
<p>The <strong>lunch</strong> has been very tasty, I had the possibility to eat some
local recipes, not bad at all.</p>
<p>After lunch we had a short session on <strong>Qt</strong>. The version 4.8 is going
to be released in a couple of months, while 5.0 is announced to be
released in 1 year from now: it will be almost code-compatible with 4.x,
it will have an improved support for Qt Quick and QML.</p>
<p>As last track of the day I decided to follow "<strong>Personal Cloud</strong>". Not a
perfect track, since the person who should have been here was only
talking with us using Skype and it was more difficoult to hear what he
said.</p>
<p>At the end of this day there was the "<strong>Meet &amp; Greet</strong>" party, sponsored
by Freescale and Openstack. They offered a dinner and we had some good
music after it.</p>
