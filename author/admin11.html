</footer><!-- /.post-info -->                <p>During the last UDS party, I had an idea to improve Ubuntu development,
but I didn't know if it could be a good idea or a stupid one, so I
talked to <strong>Daniel Holbach</strong> and <strong>David Planella</strong> about it and they
were happy to hear about it and Daniel told me to talk about
this directly to <strong>Mark</strong> (and I did it).</p>
<p>Let's explain the basic idea.</p>
<p>From an UDS and the next one, it would be useful to have a
development sprint where people can talk about assigned UDS blueprints,
at which point they are on their tasks, if they have any problems and if
they will finish them within the next UDS.</p>
<p>Of course Canonical cannot organize another meeting, it would be
very expensive, so the idea is: why don't we use <strong>Google Hangout</strong> to
organize the sprint? I has a limit of 10 people, I know, but we could
select (for example) 5 from the community and 5 from Canonical. There
would be parallel meeting and tracks, we would use the same blueprints
used during the last UDS and we would add further notes. The
attendees would be able to listen and watch the stream and make
questions through the available chat.</p>
<p>I've also created a <strong>wiki</strong> page with more informations and you can
find it here: <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuReleaseSprint">https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuReleaseSprint</a></p>
<p>What do you think about? I know that Canonical is already
organizing sprints and this could be a way to involve more the Ubuntu
Community. Maybe we should schedule a session <strong>at next UDS</strong> to talk
about this?</p>
<p>I hope to get some <strong>feedback</strong> from you.</p>

is a library written in <strong>Qt</strong> that allows applications to easily
connect to services like <strong>Facebook</strong> and <strong>Twitter</strong>. Recently I had
the opportunity to work on this library improving it and adding support
for <strong>Instagram</strong> (work is still in progress but it's almost finished).</p>
<p><a href="http://www.andreagrandi.it/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/SocialConnect.png"><img alt="" src="http://www.andreagrandi.it/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/SocialConnect.png" title="SocialConnect">{.aligncenter
.wp-image-695 width="599"
height="421"}</a></p>
<p>The <strong>main features</strong> of this library are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Out-of-the-box support for Facebook and Twitter</li>
<li>Integrated authentication implementation</li>
<li>Simplified common interface for all supported services</li>
<li>Provides interfaces for native API calls</li>
<li>Design enabling easy addition of new services e.g. LinkedIn</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are writing an application that needs to access these services,
this could be the library for you. It can be extended to support even
other services like LinkedIn, Flickr etc... and I would like to invite
people to contribute to the code. The library has been tested with <strong>Qt
4.8.1</strong> on <strong>Ubuntu Linux 12.04</strong> but it should be compatible with any
other versions/platforms.</p>

For more informations about getting started with the library, I suggest
you to give a look at this
page <https://projects.developer.nokia.com/socialconnect/wiki/GettingStarted>

<p>I don't want to write more details here because I don't think it's the
right place (and probably it's not the moment to write a similar blog
post, since I'm still in th SFO Airport), my idea is to create a wiki
page to explain all the details, so everyone would be able to add more
ideas and see if it's doable or not.</p>
<p>So, what do you think about? I think we should try, it doesn't cost
anything except some hours in the week we'll organize it. I wait for
your comments then.</p>

<p>After upgrading my desktop PC to <strong>Ubuntu 12.04</strong> (actually my main
machine) I started experimenting many <strong>Xorg crashes</strong> and instability
issues. I <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/nvidia-graphics-drivers/+bug/986445">reported the
bug</a>,
but I had to find a solution or I should have rolled back to Ubuntu
11.10. The problem (from my point of view) is of the new <strong>Nvidia
295.40</strong> binary drivers. I also tried an older version (295.33)
experiencing the same problems. I then decided to give the
<strong><a href="http://nouveau.freedesktop.org">Nouveau</a></strong> opensource drivers a try.</p>
<p>I must say that in over 24 hours I didn't have a single Xorg crash. My
desktop is very stable and Nouveau drivers are pretty fast: I can watch
a 1080p video on Youtube in full screen without having any problem. The
only problem with my machine is that I'm using a VGA Switcher to share
my monitor wit Xbox (see <a href="http://www.andreagrandi.it/2012/02/26/sharing-your-pc-monitor-with-your-xbox-using-a-vga-switcher/">this old
post</a>),
so my monitor capabilities cannot be detected automatically and I had to
do some manually tuning of the Xorg configuration.</p>
<p>First of all I had to resolve a very annoying problem: the screen was
blinking every 10 seconds and this really hurted my eyes. To fix this I
had to add a kernel parameter: <strong>drm_kms_helper.poll=0<br>
</strong>you need to add this string in <strong>/etc/default/grub</strong> to
the <strong>GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT</strong> parameter. After this your line
should look like this one: <strong>GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash
drm_kms_helper.poll=0"</strong></p>
<p>Don't forget to execute: <strong>sudo update-grub</strong> from the command line.</p>
<p>Then I had to create a proper <strong>xorg.conf</strong> setting my resolution
(1680x1050) manually:</p>
<p>[sourcecode lang="text"]<br>
Section "Monitor"<br>
Identifier "DVI-I-1"<br>
VendorName "Asus"<br>
ModelName "Ancor Communications Inc VW222"<br>
Modeline "1680x1050R" 119.00 1680 1728 1760 1840 1050 1053 1059 1080
+hsync -vsync<br>
Option "PreferredMode" "1680x1050R"<br>
EndSection</p>
<p>Section "Screen"<br>
Identifier "Screen0"<br>
Monitor "DVI-I-1"<br>
EndSection<br>
[/sourcecode]</p>
<p>How do you generate the <strong>Modeline</strong> line? It's very simple. Just
execute: "<strong>cvt -r 1680 1050</strong>" in the command line and you'll get a
line similar to the one I added (of course substitute those numbers with
the resolution you want).</p>
<p>You have to save this file in <strong>/etc/X11/xorg.conf</strong> and reboot your
system to use all the new settings. Now my system runs nicely and very
fast! I'm really enjoying the new <strong>Ubuntu 12.04 Precise Pangolin</strong>. I
just hope that Nvidia guys will fix the sta<br>
bility issues of their driver as soon as possible, so I'll be able to
choose again between the opensource driver and the closed source one
(faster with 3D stuff, but more unstable as you can see).</p>
<p>A big <strong>thanks</strong> to everyone in <strong>#nouveau</strong> <strong>IRC</strong> channel on
<strong>Freenode</strong>. They were very kind to help me configuring their
opensource driver.</p>
