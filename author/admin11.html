      <p>I've been a Flickr pro user for 4 years, but the pro account costs
<strong>24,95\$/year</strong> and I was looking for something cheaper. Anyway I was
thinking that after all, even if I don't renew my account, I can always
access to all my pictures.... wrong! <strong>If you don't renew your pro
Flickr account you can only access to the low resolution version of your
own pictures.</strong> That's not acceptable for me, so I decided to download
all my pictures and upload them somewhere else. Here comes the second
disappointment: <strong>there is no automatic way to download all your
pictures</strong>.</p>
<p>I simply had no time to write an application by myself, so I started
searching on Google to see if there was something available to do this
simple task. At the beginning I only found abandoned tools (closed
source, the API was expired ecc...), paid tools, Windows only tools
ecc... but finally I found this
post <a href="http://hivelogic.com/articles/backing-up-flickr/">http://hivelogic.com/articles/backing-up-flickr/</a></p>
<p>There is a Python script that automatically downloads all your Flickr
pictures getting the highest resolution available, you can download the
script from here <a href="https://github.com/dan/hivelogic-flickrtouchr">https://github.com/dan/hivelogic-flickrtouchr</a></p>
<p>The usage is very simple</p>
<p>[sourcecode lang="text"]<br>
mkdir FlickrBackupFolder<br>
python flickrtouchr.py FlickrBackupFolder<br>
[/sourcecode]</p>
<p>A browser's window will be opened and you'll be prompted for
authorization. After that, all you pictures will be downloaded.</p>

      Posted on Wed 12 October 2011 in <a href="https://www.andreagrandi.it/category/linux-ubuntu-en.html">Linux, Ubuntu (EN)</a>

</div>

<p>Tomorrow <strong>Ubuntu 11.10</strong> (Oneiric Ocelot) will be released officially
and I decided to test the RC (release candidate) version on my desktop
PC. Being involved in Unity-2D development I used only that desktop
environment on my development virtual machine so I didn't have much time
to test Unity (3D version).</p>
<p>I must admit that there have been a lot of improvements from 11.04
(Natty Narval) release, but also a lot of <strong>bugs</strong> and <strong>regressions</strong>
have been introduced. I've noted all the problems I found in every day
use and as soon as possible I'll also submit proper <strong>bug report on
Launchpad</strong> for each of them. In the mean time you can give a look to
the following list.</p>
<h2>Bugs and regressions</h2>
<p><strong>Notifications broken:</strong> on Ubuntu Natty when an application wants to
notify of a new message it popups an icon from the Launcher, then
displays a small blue triangle in the top-left corner of the screen.
Oneiric doesn’t have the small blue triangle anymore. In this way, if
the user is looking away when he gets a notification, he can miss it for
hours. There’s no way to know that there is a notify without manually
going with mouse to the left and making the launcher to appear.</p>
<p><strong>Launcher visibility:</strong> on Ubuntu Natty when the user moves the mouse
in the top-left corner the Launcher is shown. Oneiric doesn’t show
Launcher if you move the mouse in the top-left corner. You can’t use the
top 30-40 pixels (the height of the panel).</p>
<p><strong>Notify area icons:</strong> often in Oneiric when you click an icon in the
notify area (for example the volume icon, the network manager icon
ecc...) the popup is shown and suddenly hidden. You have to click a
second time to view it.</p>
<p><strong>Notify icon - Empathy:</strong> in Oneiric you cannot open Empathy from the
notify area. If you click on “Chat” Empathy is open and visible on the
Launcher but not on the screen. You have to move to mouse to the
launcher then click on it to view the application window.</p>
<p><strong>Empathy:</strong> “Automatically connect on startup” doesn’t work. If you
enable this option in Empathy it doesn’t start anyway when the system
start.</p>
<p><strong>Launcher doesn’t work as expected:</strong> sometimes when you move the mouse
on the left, Launcher is not shown. You can try it many times and it
still doesn’t appear. I’ve to SUPER+D a couple of times (to show/hide
Desktop) to show view it. Even the opposite problem happens: sometime
you cannot hide the Launcher.</p>
<p><strong>Boot failing:</strong> every time I boot Oneiric the first boot fails. I
cannot know what happens because nothing is shown on video. I press
CTRL+ALT+CANC, the system reboot and then boot normally.</p>
<p><strong>Showing Skype:</strong> on Natty you just need to double-click on Skype icon
in the notify bar to show it, now you need to click once on the icon,
choose “Activate” from menu and you show it. Why the need to complicate
an easy thing?</p>
<p><strong>Webcam problems with Skype:</strong> with Natty I could use my webcam with
Skype without any problem. Now I can still use it but if I activate the
view of myself during a videcall, the video completly locks and it
doesn’t work anymore. Skype is always the same version, so probably
there is a problem with the new driver used.</p>
<p><strong>Window manager:</strong> sometimes moving an application window doesn’t work.
You drag a window around the screen then suddenly the window stop moving
and the mouse icon starts vibrating. You have to release and click again
to move the window and stop mouse icon vibrating.</p>
<h2>[Conclusion]{.Apple-style-span style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;"}</h2>
<div>

In the next days I'll work on checking for these bugs on Launchpad to
see if they're already submitted and if not I'll submit them, hoping
they will be fixed as soon as possible before end users start bothering
about them.

this morning I didn't wake up early because I still felt sick (I already
know this sore throath won't abandon me untile I go back home).</p>
<p>I had a <strong>light breakfast at 10:30</strong> and then I finishes uploading some
pictures and published articles on my blog I already had written before.</p>
<p>While waiting to attend a session, I found <strong>Mark Shuttleworth</strong> around
and I congratulated with him for the effort he is putting into Ubuntu.
Without a similar distribution, I'm pretty sure that Linux would not be
so popular today.</p>
<p>We had lunch at 13:00 as usual and after that I attended a couple of
presentation. The first one on Eucalyptus, then "<strong>Cooking Recipes</strong>"
for Ubuntu and another one dedicated to <strong>Wine</strong>. The Wine session was
so funny! They had a little problem with video projector and all the
images appeared with a blur effect so that you could think to be drunk
;)</p>
<p>After these sessions I had to go back to my room since I didn't feel
very well, but I was able to attend "<strong>Unity's relations and
dependancies on GNOME</strong>" thanks to audio streaming, IRC for asking
questions and etherpad to take notes.</p>
<p>I attended also "<strong>desktop-dx-o-unity-a11y</strong>" where there was a
discussion about the state of <strong>Unity</strong> and what can be improved before
<strong>Oneiric</strong> release. Lot of work has to be done yet, in particular about
accessibility.</p>
<p>Last session of this day, a
<strong><a href="http://summit.ubuntu.com/uds-o/meeting/other-o-sabdfl-community-qa/">Q+A</a></strong>
with <strong>Mark Shuttleworth</strong>. The session was very interesting! He replied
to all questions coming from the public and from IRC.</p>
