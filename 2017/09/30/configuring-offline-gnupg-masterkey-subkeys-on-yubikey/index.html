<meta name="description" content="I&#39;ve recently bought a YubiKey 4 and decided to use it for GnuPG too, other than using it as hardware 2FA. I&#39;ve also decided to make my GnuPG configuration much more safe, generating the master key on an offline computer (in my case a simple RaspberryPi not connected to Internet) and generating a subkey that will be moved to my YubiKey. Disclaimer Always think about what your threat model is before deciding something is 100% safe for you. I&#39;m not claiming this setup/configuration is bullet proof. If you want to protect your GnuPG key from most of the hackers, keyloggers and if you want to use it on different computers without ever compromising your secret key, this setup can be what you are looking for. If you think you may be victim of a targeted state sponsored attack, I&#39;m not sure this setup could be enough. Why keeping offline the master key? If you only use your master key on a computer that never connects to Internet (I reckon you will want to update/patch it from time to time, that&#39;s why we are going to keep the master key on an external USB key) you are at least safe from remote attacks. Why using subkeys? Your GnuPG master key is also your &#34;identity&#34; among every PGP user. If you loose your master key or if your key is compromised you need to rebuild your identity and reputation from scratch. Instead, if a subkey is compromised, you can revoke the subkey (using your master key) and generate a new subkey. How a YubiKey makes things safer? If you always use your subkey from a YubiKey, it&#39;s very unlikely that your private key can be stolen: it&#39;s impossible to read it from the YubiKey and if you loose your YubiKey or if it&#39;s physically stolen, the attacker will still need your passphrase and your YubiKey PIN. Requirements 1 YubiKey 4 2 USB keys (in theory you only need one, but I strongly suggest you have another one as backup) 1 offline computer (a simple RaspberryPi with no Internet connection will be fine) Initial setup From now on, I will assume that you have prepared a computer for offline use (in my case I&#39;m using a RaspberryPi 2 with Raspbian) and you will type the next commands there and only there. Plug one of the USB key (you can format it with VFAT for simplicity) in the offline computer and wait for the system to mount it. At this point it should be mounted in a path like this: /media/AABB-BAAC Now set the GnuPG working directory and create it: user@debian:~$ export GNUPGHOME=/media/AABB-BAAC/gnupghome user@debian:~$ mkdir $GNUPGHOME Second disclaimer If you think your threat model doesn&#39;t include someone can hack your computer from remote, you can ignore my advice and type these commands on your main laptop (at your own risk). Note For my own convenience, to write this tutorial I reproduced all these steps on my MacBook because it was easier to copy/paste commands and outputs but I&#39;ve tested it with the exact setup I&#39;m describing, and it should be compatible with OSX and Linux. When you see something has been masked it&#39;s just to hide (from spam) things like my email or to protect the serial number of my YubiKey. Last but not least, the output shown here could not match exactly the one you get on your own PC and this also depends on the GnuPG version you are using. Generating the master key The master key must be generated using the advanced mode, because by default when a new master key is generated, also a new subkey is created with all the capabilities (Authentication + Signing + Encryption), while we want something different. Note: PGP keys up to 4096 bits are only supported in YubiKey 4 models. If you have a YubiKey NEO you must use a 2048 bits key because it&#39;s the maximum size supported. Here you will create a PGP key with only the Authentication capability. If your GnuPG version doesn&#39;t allow this, choose &#34;sign only&#34;, just don&#39;t create the encryption capability at this time. user@debian:~$ gpg --expert --gen-key gpg (GnuPG) 2.0.30; Copyright (C) 2015 Free Software Foundation, Inc.

If the key is not read automatically, you may need to give it a refresh using this command: user@debian:~$ gpg --card-status Careful with PINs Please remember that you can only digit a wrong user PIN for a maximum of three times. After three time you will need to edit the YubiKey (with gpg --card-edit) become admin and use the unblock PIN option. If you digit the wrong admin PIN for three time, you will have to follow a quite complicated procedure (explained at this address: https://developers.yubico.com/ykneo-openpgp/ResetApplet.html) and your YubiKey will be reset with factory settings, deleting your PGP keys from it.

<meta property="og:title" content="Configuring an offline GnuPG master key and subkeys on YubiKey"/>
<meta property="og:description" content="I&#39;ve recently bought a YubiKey 4 and decided to use it for GnuPG too, other than using it as hardware 2FA. I&#39;ve also decided to make my GnuPG configuration much more safe, generating the master key on an offline computer (in my case a simple RaspberryPi not connected to Internet) and generating a subkey that will be moved to my YubiKey. Disclaimer Always think about what your threat model is before deciding something is 100% safe for you. I&#39;m not claiming this setup/configuration is bullet proof. If you want to protect your GnuPG key from most of the hackers, keyloggers and if you want to use it on different computers without ever compromising your secret key, this setup can be what you are looking for. If you think you may be victim of a targeted state sponsored attack, I&#39;m not sure this setup could be enough. Why keeping offline the master key? If you only use your master key on a computer that never connects to Internet (I reckon you will want to update/patch it from time to time, that&#39;s why we are going to keep the master key on an external USB key) you are at least safe from remote attacks. Why using subkeys? Your GnuPG master key is also your &#34;identity&#34; among every PGP user. If you loose your master key or if your key is compromised you need to rebuild your identity and reputation from scratch. Instead, if a subkey is compromised, you can revoke the subkey (using your master key) and generate a new subkey. How a YubiKey makes things safer? If you always use your subkey from a YubiKey, it&#39;s very unlikely that your private key can be stolen: it&#39;s impossible to read it from the YubiKey and if you loose your YubiKey or if it&#39;s physically stolen, the attacker will still need your passphrase and your YubiKey PIN. Requirements 1 YubiKey 4 2 USB keys (in theory you only need one, but I strongly suggest you have another one as backup) 1 offline computer (a simple RaspberryPi with no Internet connection will be fine) Initial setup From now on, I will assume that you have prepared a computer for offline use (in my case I&#39;m using a RaspberryPi 2 with Raspbian) and you will type the next commands there and only there. Plug one of the USB key (you can format it with VFAT for simplicity) in the offline computer and wait for the system to mount it. At this point it should be mounted in a path like this: /media/AABB-BAAC Now set the GnuPG working directory and create it: user@debian:~$ export GNUPGHOME=/media/AABB-BAAC/gnupghome user@debian:~$ mkdir $GNUPGHOME Second disclaimer If you think your threat model doesn&#39;t include someone can hack your computer from remote, you can ignore my advice and type these commands on your main laptop (at your own risk). Note For my own convenience, to write this tutorial I reproduced all these steps on my MacBook because it was easier to copy/paste commands and outputs but I&#39;ve tested it with the exact setup I&#39;m describing, and it should be compatible with OSX and Linux. When you see something has been masked it&#39;s just to hide (from spam) things like my email or to protect the serial number of my YubiKey. Last but not least, the output shown here could not match exactly the one you get on your own PC and this also depends on the GnuPG version you are using. Generating the master key The master key must be generated using the advanced mode, because by default when a new master key is generated, also a new subkey is created with all the capabilities (Authentication + Signing + Encryption), while we want something different. Note: PGP keys up to 4096 bits are only supported in YubiKey 4 models. If you have a YubiKey NEO you must use a 2048 bits key because it&#39;s the maximum size supported. Here you will create a PGP key with only the Authentication capability. If your GnuPG version doesn&#39;t allow this, choose &#34;sign only&#34;, just don&#39;t create the encryption capability at this time. user@debian:~$ gpg --expert --gen-key gpg (GnuPG) 2.0.30; Copyright (C) 2015 Free Software Foundation, Inc.

If the key is not read automatically, you may need to give it a refresh using this command: user@debian:~$ gpg --card-status Careful with PINs Please remember that you can only digit a wrong user PIN for a maximum of three times. After three time you will need to edit the YubiKey (with gpg --card-edit) become admin and use the unblock PIN option. If you digit the wrong admin PIN for three time, you will have to follow a quite complicated procedure (explained at this address: https://developers.yubico.com/ykneo-openpgp/ResetApplet.html) and your YubiKey will be reset with factory settings, deleting your PGP keys from it.

    <p>
      Posted on Sat 30 September 2017 in <a href="https://www.andreagrandi.it/category/howto.html">HowTo</a>

    </p>
  </header>


  <div>
    <p>I've recently bought a <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Yubico-Y-158-YubiKey-4-Black/dp/B018Y1Q71M/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1507054059&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=yubico+4&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=andreagrandi-21&amp;linkId=6da97357c6fe86ca94df918c172f6605">YubiKey 4</a> and 
decided to use it for GnuPG too, other than using it as hardware 2FA.</p>
<p>I've also decided to make my GnuPG configuration much more safe, generating the <strong>master key</strong>
on an <strong>offline</strong> computer (in my case a simple RaspberryPi not connected to Internet) and <strong>generating a subkey</strong>
that will be moved to my <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Yubico-Y-158-YubiKey-4-Black/dp/B018Y1Q71M/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1507054059&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=yubico+4&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=andreagrandi-21&amp;linkId=6da97357c6fe86ca94df918c172f6605">YubiKey</a>.</p>
<h4>Disclaimer</h4>
<p>Always think about what your <strong>threat model</strong> is before deciding something is 100% safe for you.
I'm not claiming this setup/configuration is bullet proof. If you want to protect your GnuPG key from most of the hackers,
keyloggers and if you want to use it on different computers without ever compromising your secret key, this setup
can be what you are looking for. If you think you may be victim of a targeted state sponsored attack, I'm not sure this
setup could be enough.</p>
<h4>Why keeping offline the master key?</h4>
<p>If you only use your master key on a computer that never connects to Internet (I reckon you will want to update/patch it
from time to time, that's why we are going to keep the master key on an external USB key) you are at least safe from remote attacks.</p>
<h4>Why using subkeys?</h4>
<p>Your GnuPG master key is also your "identity" among every PGP user. If you loose your master key or if your key is compromised
you need to rebuild your identity and reputation from scratch. Instead, if a subkey is compromised, you can revoke the subkey (using your
master key) and generate a new subkey.</p>
<h4>How a YubiKey makes things safer?</h4>
<p>If you always use your subkey from a <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Yubico-Y-158-YubiKey-4-Black/dp/B018Y1Q71M/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1507054059&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=yubico+4&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=andreagrandi-21&amp;linkId=6da97357c6fe86ca94df918c172f6605">YubiKey</a>, it's very unlikely that your
private key can be stolen: it's impossible to read it from the <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Yubico-Y-158-YubiKey-4-Black/dp/B018Y1Q71M/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1507054059&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=yubico+4&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=andreagrandi-21&amp;linkId=6da97357c6fe86ca94df918c172f6605">YubiKey</a> and if you loose your YubiKey
or if it's physically stolen, the attacker will still need your passphrase and your YubiKey PIN.</p>
<h3>Requirements</h3>
<ul>
<li>1 <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Yubico-Y-158-YubiKey-4-Black/dp/B018Y1Q71M/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1507054059&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=yubico+4&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=andreagrandi-21&amp;linkId=6da97357c6fe86ca94df918c172f6605">YubiKey 4</a></li>
<li>2 USB keys (in theory you only need one, but I strongly suggest you have another one as backup)</li>
<li>1 offline computer (a simple RaspberryPi with no Internet connection will be fine)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Initial setup</h3>
<p>From now on, I will assume that you have prepared a computer for offline use (in my case I'm using a RaspberryPi 2 with
Raspbian) and you will type the next commands there and only there.</p>
<p>Plug one of the <strong>USB key</strong> (you can format it with VFAT for simplicity) in the offline computer and wait for the system to mount it.
At this point it should be mounted in a path like this: <strong>/media/AABB-BAAC</strong></p>
<p>Now set the GnuPG working directory and create it:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>user@debian:~$ export GNUPGHOME=/media/AABB-BAAC/gnupghome
user@debian:~$ mkdir $GNUPGHOME
</code></pre></div>

<h4>Second disclaimer</h4>
<p>If you think your threat model doesn't include someone can hack your computer from remote,
you can ignore my advice and type these commands on your main laptop (at your own risk).</p>
<h4>Note</h4>
<p>For my own convenience, to write this tutorial I reproduced all these steps on my MacBook because it was easier to copy/paste
commands and outputs but I've tested it with the exact setup I'm describing, and it
should be compatible with OSX and Linux.
When you see something has been masked it's just to hide (from spam) things like my email or to protect the serial number
of my <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Yubico-Y-158-YubiKey-4-Black/dp/B018Y1Q71M/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1507054059&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=yubico+4&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=andreagrandi-21&amp;linkId=6da97357c6fe86ca94df918c172f6605">YubiKey</a>. Last but not least, the output shown here could not match exactly the one you get on your own PC and this also
depends on the GnuPG version you are using.</p>
<h3>Generating the master key</h3>
<p>The master key must be generated using the advanced mode, because by default when a new master key is generated, also a new subkey
is created with all the capabilities (Authentication + Signing + Encryption), while we want something different.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> PGP keys up to <strong>4096 bits</strong> are only supported in <strong>YubiKey 4</strong> models. If you have a <strong>YubiKey NEO</strong> you must use
a <strong>2048 bits</strong> key because it's the maximum size supported. Here you will create a PGP key with <strong>only
the Authentication capability</strong>. If your GnuPG version doesn't allow this, choose "sign only", just don't
create the encryption capability at this time.</p>

GnuPG needs to construct a user ID to identify your key.

Real name: Andrea Grandi
Email address: user@email.com
Comment:
You selected this USER-ID:
    &quot;Andrea Grandi &lt;user@email.com&gt;&quot;

Change (N)ame, (C)omment, (E)mail or (O)kay/(Q)uit? o
You need a Passphrase to protect your secret key.

We need to generate a lot of random bytes. It is a good idea to perform
some other action (type on the keyboard, move the mouse, utilize the
disks) during the prime generation; this gives the random number
generator a better chance to gain enough entropy.

<p><strong>Note:</strong> please remember to save your passphrase in a safe place. Choose something you
can remember because you will need it every time you need to sign, encrypt or decrypt something.</p>
<h3>Creating a revocation certificate</h3>
<p>It's very important to create a revocation certificate to be used if and when 
in the future you want to change your master key and revoke the existing one:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>user@debian:~$ gpg --gen-revoke 2240402E &gt; 2240402E-revocation-certificate.asc

sec  4096R/2240402E 2017-09-25 Andrea Grandi &lt;user@email.com&gt;

Create a revocation certificate for this key? (y/N) y
Please select the reason for the revocation:
0 = No reason specified
1 = Key has been compromised
2 = Key is superseded
3 = Key is no longer used
Q = Cancel
(Probably you want to select 1 here)
Your decision? 3
Enter an optional description; end it with an empty line:
&gt;
Reason for revocation: Key is no longer used
(No description given)
Is this okay? (y/N) y

You need a passphrase to unlock the secret key for
user: &quot;Andrea Grandi &lt;user@email.com&gt;&quot;
4096-bit RSA key, ID 2240402E, created 2017-09-25

ASCII armored output forced.
Revocation certificate created.

Please move it to a medium which you can hide away; if Mallory gets
access to this certificate he can use it to make your key unusable.
It is smart to print this certificate and store it away, just in case
your media become unreadable.  But have some caution:  The print system of
your machine might store the data and make it available to others!
</code></pre></div>

<h3>Creating Encryption subkey</h3>
<p>To create a subkey we need to edit the existing key (please note that <strong>2240402E</strong>
is the last 8 chars from the fingerprint of the previously generated master key)
and specify we want to create an Encryption only key.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>user@debian:~$ gpg --edit-key 2240402E

to the <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Yubico-Y-158-YubiKey-4-Black/dp/B018Y1Q71M/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1507054059&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=yubico+4&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=andreagrandi-21&amp;linkId=6da97357c6fe86ca94df918c172f6605">YubiKey</a>, they are not copied.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>user@debian:~$ gpg --export-secret-key 2240402E &gt; 2240402E-secret.pgp
</code></pre></div>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> this backup includes both the secret master key and the secret subkey.
Please remember to <strong>save a backup of this key</strong> on a couple of separate USB keys: you will need
this keys to generate future subkeys and/or to revoke the existing ones.</p>
<h3>Programming the YubiKey with all GnuPG keys</h3>
<p>We have previously created the <strong>master key</strong> and the <strong>encryption subkey</strong>. Now we will
create the <strong>authentication</strong> and <strong>signing</strong> keys directly on the <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Yubico-Y-158-YubiKey-4-Black/dp/B018Y1Q71M/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1507054059&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=yubico+4&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=andreagrandi-21&amp;linkId=6da97357c6fe86ca94df918c172f6605">YubiKey</a> (we don't
need to have a copy of these keys) and we will move the secret encryption key
to the <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Yubico-Y-158-YubiKey-4-Black/dp/B018Y1Q71M/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1507054059&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=yubico+4&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=andreagrandi-21&amp;linkId=6da97357c6fe86ca94df918c172f6605">YubiKey</a>.</p>

<h4>Check public keys</h4>
<p>Just to verify everything has been created correctly, we check the public keys.
We should see one <strong>pub</strong> key and three <strong>sub</strong>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>user@debian:~$ gpg -k
/media/AABB-BAAC/gnupghome/pubring.gpg
--------------------------------

</code></pre></div>

<h4>Check private keys</h4>
<p>When we check the private keys we should see that one key is still local, marked as <strong>sec</strong> (it's
the private key of the master key), while three other keys are marked as <strong>ssb&gt;</strong>
which means they have been moved to the <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Yubico-Y-158-YubiKey-4-Black/dp/B018Y1Q71M/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1507054059&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=yubico+4&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=andreagrandi-21&amp;linkId=6da97357c6fe86ca94df918c172f6605">YubiKey</a>:</p>

<h4>Import back secret keys from backup (only for multiple YubiKeys)</h4>
<p>As previously said, when we write the encryption subkey to the <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Yubico-Y-158-YubiKey-4-Black/dp/B018Y1Q71M/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1507054059&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=yubico+4&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=andreagrandi-21&amp;linkId=6da97357c6fe86ca94df918c172f6605">YubiKey</a>, the key
is <strong>moved</strong> and not just copied, so we need to import back the secret key into
the keyring. It's important to have a backup of the subkey too, not because we need it
in case the key is compromised etc... but because we need it in case we want to write
multiple YubiKeys with the same encryption key, so that we have a backup key to use.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>user@debian:~$ gpg --import &lt; 2240402E-secret.pgp
</code></pre></div>

<h4>Completely remove secret keys from laptop</h4>
<p>Once you have programmed the <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Yubico-Y-158-YubiKey-4-Black/dp/B018Y1Q71M/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1507054059&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=yubico+4&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=andreagrandi-21&amp;linkId=6da97357c6fe86ca94df918c172f6605">YubiKey</a> and you are sure the secret keys are
backed up on a couple of USB keys, you are ready to remove the secret keys from your laptop.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> you don't need to remove anything if you have conducted the whole setup
on a spare offline PC (or on a RaspberryPi) because that's not your every day computer.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>user@debian:~$ gpg --delete-secret-key 2240402E
</code></pre></div>

<h3>Exporting the public PGP key</h3>
<p>As you know, PGP keys are composed by a secret part and a public one. The public one
must be distributed publicly and it's the one people will use to encrypt messages directed
to you.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>user@debian:~$ gpg --armor --export 2240402E &gt; 2240402E.asc
</code></pre></div>

<p>If you have a personal blog/website I suggest to upload it there (for example mine
can be found here <a href="https://www.andreagrandi.it/2240402E.asc">https://www.andreagrandi.it/2240402E.asc</a>)</p>
<h3>Change YubiKey PINs and complete configuration</h3>
<p>Every <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Yubico-Y-158-YubiKey-4-Black/dp/B018Y1Q71M/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1507054059&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=yubico+4&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=andreagrandi-21&amp;linkId=6da97357c6fe86ca94df918c172f6605">YubiKey</a> is sold with a certain default configuration: there is a <strong>user PIN</strong>
that is required every time we need to use the key to sign/decrypt something (in addition
to our passphrase) and there is an <strong>admin PIN</strong> that is required every time we change
certain settings on the <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Yubico-Y-158-YubiKey-4-Black/dp/B018Y1Q71M/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1507054059&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=yubico+4&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=andreagrandi-21&amp;linkId=6da97357c6fe86ca94df918c172f6605">YubiKey</a>.</p>
<p>The default values are:</p>
<ul>
<li>user PIN: 123456</li>
<li>admin PIN: 12345678</li>
</ul>
<p>I strongly recommend you to change them following this example:</p>

you need to at least import your public PGP key into the keyring. If the key is not

<h4>Careful with PINs</h4>
<p>Please remember that you can only digit a wrong user PIN for a maximum of three times.
After three time you will need to edit the <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Yubico-Y-158-YubiKey-4-Black/dp/B018Y1Q71M/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1507054059&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=yubico+4&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=andreagrandi-21&amp;linkId=6da97357c6fe86ca94df918c172f6605">YubiKey</a> (with <strong>gpg --card-edit</strong>) become admin
and use the <strong>unblock PIN</strong> option. If you digit the wrong admin PIN for three time, you will have
to follow a quite complicated procedure (explained at this address: <a href="https://developers.yubico.com/ykneo-openpgp/ResetApplet.html">https://developers.yubico.com/ykneo-openpgp/ResetApplet.html</a>)
and your <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Yubico-Y-158-YubiKey-4-Black/dp/B018Y1Q71M/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1507054059&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=yubico+4&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=andreagrandi-21&amp;linkId=6da97357c6fe86ca94df918c172f6605">YubiKey</a> will be reset with factory settings, deleting your PGP keys from it.</p>

<h4>Amazon Association disclaimer</h4>
<p>I'm trying a little experiment with the Amazon Association program. Basically, if you click
on any of the YubiKey links and decide to buy it, I will get a little commission from it.
I've never tried this before and I've no idea if it works or not. I'm writing this here just for the
sake of transparency.</p>
