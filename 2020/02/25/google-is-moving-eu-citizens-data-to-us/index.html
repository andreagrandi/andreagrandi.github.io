<meta content="What is going on As you may have heard already, because of brexit, Google is moving UK citizens data from the Northern Ireland data controller to the US one (Google LLC). Leaving the EU, UK citizens are not protected anymore by GDPR, and while this may be unfair, Google is legally allowed to do it. The problem Even if I'm an Italian citizen and I live in Italy, a few days ago I received this email from them: What's wrong with it? The point is that I'm an Italian citizen, living in Italy. I have nothing to do with UK (even if I lived there for a few years in the past, my account was created from Italy). Why do they mention &quot;UK leaving EU&quot; to me, if I don't live in UK? I tried to contact them multiple times on their @Google account on Twitter, but I got no reply at all. I tried to search online and it looks like I'm not alone, they are doing this to many other people: https://support.google.com/accounts/thread/29317992?hl=en&amp;authuser=1 Looking for help What should I do? Is this legally allowed? If there was an easy way to complain with them, I would have done it already, but I've tried to search on their website (even googling it... no pun intended) but I couldn't find a single contact form to report this issue and of course they are ignoring both Twitter and that forum I linked previously. Should I report them to the Privacy Authority? If yes, how? Full text of the email Here is the full text of the email I received: We’re improving our Terms of Service and making them easier for you to understand.

<h2>What is going on</h2>
<p>As you may have heard already, because of <strong>brexit</strong>, <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/google-uk-us-data-brexit-gdpr-trump-protection-information-a9348191.html">Google is moving UK citizens data</a> from the Northern Ireland data controller to the US one (Google LLC).
Leaving the EU, UK citizens are not protected anymore by GDPR, and while this may be unfair, Google is legally allowed to do it.</p>
<h2>The problem</h2>
<p>Even if I'm an Italian citizen and I live in Italy, a few days ago I received this email from them:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.andreagrandi.it/images/2020/02/google-data-controller-email.png"><img alt="google data controller" src="https://www.andreagrandi.it/images/2020/02/google-data-controller-email.png" width="90%"/></a></p>
<h2>What's wrong with it?</h2>
<p>The point is that I'm an <strong>Italian citizen</strong>, living in <strong>Italy</strong>. 
I <strong>have nothing to do with UK</strong> (even if I lived there for a few years in the past, my account was created from Italy).</p>
<p>Why do they mention "UK leaving EU" to me, if I don't live in UK?</p>
<p>I tried to contact them multiple times on their <a href="https://twitter.com/Google">@Google</a> account on Twitter, but I got no reply at all. I tried to search online and it looks like I'm not alone, they are doing this to many other people: <a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/thread/29317992?hl=en&amp;authuser=1">https://support.google.com/accounts/thread/29317992?hl=en&amp;authuser=1</a></p>
<h2>Looking for help</h2>
<p>What should I do? Is this legally allowed?</p>
<p>If there was an easy way to complain with them, I would have done it already, but I've tried to search on their website 
(even googling it... no pun intended) but <strong>I couldn't find a single contact form</strong> to report this issue and of course <strong>they are ignoring</strong> both Twitter and that forum I linked previously.</p>
<p>Should I <strong>report them</strong> to the <strong>Privacy Authority</strong>? If yes, how?</p>
