</footer><!-- /.post-info -->                <p>Using the same computer with Windows 8 and Ubuntu I noticed that the
sound was worse in Ubuntu and I discovered why soon: <strong>subwoofer</strong>
doesn't work out of the box!</p>
<h3>How to fix it</h3>
<p>The fix is quite easy to apply (but it was not easy to find the right
one!). First of all edit <strong>/etc/pulse/default.pa</strong> and add this line at
the end:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>load-module module-combine <span class="nv">channels</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="m">6</span> <span class="nv">channel_map</span><span class="o">=</span>front-left,front-right,rear-left,rear-right,front-center,lfe
</pre></div>


<p>then edit <strong>/etc/pulse/daemon.conf</strong>, modify the line
"enable-lfe-remixing: no" to "<strong>enable-lfe-remixing: yes</strong>", then
uncomment it (remove the semicolon in front of it). Reboot your PC and
enjoy the subwoofer!</p>

</footer><!-- /.post-info -->                <p>When last week <a href="http://fridge.ubuntu.com/2013/02/26/ubuntu-developer-summits-now-online-and-every-three-months/">Canonical
announced</a>
the usual UDS was not going to happen I was a bit shocked and
disappointed: starting from the next UDS (that is going to happen
tomorrow!) the event will be <strong>online only</strong> and <strong>every 3 months</strong>.
During these days I've been thinking a lot about this move and I will
tell you what are the pros and cons, in my opinion, followed by some
final thoughts.</p>
<h2>Pros</h2>
<p>Having 4 UDS every year, instead of 2, is surely a better thing. I'm a
big fan of Scrum methodology, so I think that <strong>iterating more often is
better</strong> than iterating less. If there are any mistakes you can correct
them and iterating again before releasing the final product.</p>
<p>Potentially <strong>more people can partecipate</strong> to the event (even the
opposite is true and I will explain why). People won't need to move from
home, travel, pay any expense etc... they just need a computer and a
good Internet connection.</p>
<p>It's <strong>cheaper for everyone</strong>: I can just imagine how expensive could be
for Canonical to organize a similar event. Booking a big hotel, paying
travel and expenses to near one houndred of community people. People who
didn't get any sponsorization had to pay all the travel expenses to
attend the event.</p>
<h2>Cons</h2>
<p>Potentially <strong>less people can partecipate</strong> to the event. Yes, like I
said before even this sentence is true and I will explain why. First of
all, using Google+ there are at least three countries that will be cut
out: <strong>China</strong>, <strong>Thailand</strong> and <strong>Vietnam</strong>. Google+ is not available
in those countries.</p>
<p>Are you sure that special people will be able to follow the event? For
example <strong>blind people</strong> won't be able to chat or to ask question in the
chat.</p>
<p><strong>Only 10 people</strong> will be able to talk. In normal UDS sessions more
people could raise the hand and ask a question or interact with the
track leaders. Who will choose the 10 people with audio+video streaming
rights?</p>
<p>We will <strong>completly miss the social aspect</strong> of the UDS. If you think
this was only a secondary part, please go on. I felt more committed to
work and collaborate with people I met in person than with someone I've
never met before.</p>
<p>Announcing an event, even if online, just <strong>one week before</strong> it
happens. Really? Some people had already taken vacation from work,
booked flights etc... not counting many people that can't take 2 days
off from work just with 1 week notice period. It's also almost
impossible that community members have the time to schedule a blueprint
and be able to discuss about a subject.</p>
<h2>Final thoughts</h2>
<p>From a <strong>cutting costs</strong> point of view I really can't say anything.
Organizing UDS was surely very expensive for Canonical and nobody can
blame them if they decided to spend those money in a different way.</p>
<p>What really concerns me: is UDS still useful? My opinion is that at
least since latest 2 or 3 UDS the presence of the Community was not so
relevant, because I had <strong>the clear sensation that the most important
decisions were made by Canonical before the UDS</strong> and then there was
just some details tuning. Another proof of my thoughts is the today
announcement: <strong>despite the fact that I 100% agree with Unity switching
to Qt/QML</strong> (I already proposed this 2 years ago during Budapest UDS,
but nobody listened to me) <strong>I completly disagree with the way the
decision was made</strong>: not a single involvement or discussion with the
community.</p>
<p>I would apreaciate <strong>more openness and honesty</strong> from Canonical. Do you
want to take all the decisions? That's fine, but at least state it
clearly.</p>

</footer><!-- /.post-info -->                <p>QtCreator is a very flexible IDE and can really be adapted for a lot of
things. I usually use it to develop mobile applications for Nokia N9 and
BlackBerry 10, but it can be used for more generic tasks. In my case I
wanted to be able to develop a Qt application using my desktop PC,
deploy it and run on a remote (actually it's on the same desk) Linux
machine running Xubuntu.</p>
<p>Doing this is quite easy and you don't need any specific plugin on
QtCreator, but be sure to have at least version 2.6.x. Other than
QtCreator you also need two Linux based PC (I used Ubuntu 12.10 for my
development machine and Xubuntu 12.10 for the remote netbook) and an SSH
account on the remote PC.</p>
<h3>Add the remote device to QtCreator</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.andreagrandi.it/images/2013/01/QtCreatorDevice.png"><img alt="QtCreatorDevice" src="https://www.andreagrandi.it/images/2013/01/QtCreatorDevice.png" width="100%"></a></p>
<p>To add the remote Linux device on QtCreator, use the
<strong>Tools-&gt;Options</strong> menu and click on "<strong>Devices</strong>" item. At this
point click on "<strong>Add</strong>" button and fill the fields using values similar
to the screenshot. In particular specify a <strong>name</strong> for the device, the
<strong>IP</strong> of the remote machine and a <strong>username</strong> and <strong>password</strong> that
must already exist (I just created the user "andrea" on the Xubuntu
machine and used the same password). I also had to set the <strong>timeout</strong>
to 20 seconds, because I had some connection problems and the connection
kept dropping after 10 seconds trying. To verify if everything is
working fine, just click on <strong>Test</strong> button.</p>
<h3>Add a specific Qt version</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.andreagrandi.it/images/2013/01/QtCreatorQtVersion.png"><img alt="QtCreatorQtVersion" src="https://www.andreagrandi.it/images/2013/01/QtCreatorQtVersion.png" width="100%"></a></p>
<p>To write your application you may need a specific Qt version that is
different from the one distributed by your Linux distribution. There's
no problem, QtCreator let you add different Qt versions without any
conflict. In my case I installed the Qt5 version distributed by
<strong>Canonical Qt5 Edgers
Team</strong>: <a href="https://launchpad.net/~canonical-qt5-edgers">https://launchpad.net/~canonical-qt5-edgers</a><br>
Once it's installed, just click on "<strong>Add</strong>" button and select the qmake
specific to the version you want to add (in my case it was in
<strong>/opt/qt5/bin/qmake</strong> ).</p>
<h3>Add a Qt Kit</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.andreagrandi.it/images/2013/01/QtCreatorQtKits.png"><img alt="QtCreatorQtKits" src="https://www.andreagrandi.it/images/2013/01/QtCreatorQtKits.png" width="100%"></a></p>
<p>QtCreator permits to add new <strong>Kit</strong> (development configurations) and
these kits are used during project creation to specify what you want to
target. In my example I added a new kit choosing an appropriate <strong>name</strong>
"Qt5 Ubuntu", the <strong>device type</strong>, the actual <strong>device</strong> previously
configured and finally the <strong>Qt version</strong> that we added before. With a
kit I have a complete "toolchain" that allow me to write applications
for a particular device, with a specific Qt version.</p>
<h3>Putting the pieces together</h3>
<p>At this point you just have to create a new "<strong>Qt Quick 2</strong>"
application, and select the new kit you just created instead of the
"Desktop" one. <strong>Please note</strong> that there is a little problem that I
haven't fixed yet (but I'm working on it): if you create, for example, a
project named "QtTest1" it will be deployed to the folder /opt/QtTest1/
on the remote machine. By default your user doesn't have read+write
permissions for that folder so I manualy created the folder and I gave a
chmod 777 on it, just for testing. There are two possible ways to fix
this: you could create a specific user that has read+write permissions
on /opt/ or you could modify the deployment configuration to have the
app deployed to the user /home (I will investigate on this possibility
and I will write something in one of the next posts).</p>
<h3>Final thoughts</h3>
<p>What all of this could be useful for? Well, do 2+2 and you'll easily
guess ;) In the next weeks I will post more specific informations and I
will update everyone with my progresses. Any comment is welcome! If you
want to contribute to this you're welcome too of course.</p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Even if it's not a new model, the <strong>HTC Desire</strong> is still a very good
Android device, thanks to its <strong>1Ghz</strong> CPU and <strong>512 Mb RAM</strong>, but one
of the biggest problems of this phone is that it comes with <strong>only
148Mb</strong> available in the ROM. Once the operating system is installed
(ROM I mean), after installing few useful applications you'll end the
available space very soon. There are many apps available, like App2SD
that move your applications to the SD card, but it's not enough because
only the application is moved, not the data. To move the data to the SD
card, there is a very nice utility called <strong>Data2SD</strong>. Please note that
this procedure requires you to reflash your device and partition your SD
card, so <strong>please do a complete backup</strong> before proceding.</p>
<h3>What you need</h3>
<ul>
<li>a <strong>rooted</strong> HTC Desire (you need to have a rooted phone with a
    <strong>recovery</strong> already installed)</li>
<li>a <strong>4Gb</strong> (or bigger) <strong>microSD</strong>, at least <strong>class 4</strong> (class 6 is
    even better while class 10 is reported not working with this phone)</li>
<li>a <strong>microSD</strong> card <strong>reader</strong></li>
<li><strong>CyanogenMod
    7</strong>: http://download.cyanogenmod.com/get/update-cm-7.0.3-Desire-signed.zip</li>
<li><strong>Data2SD</strong>: <a href="http://www.droidzone.in/roms/index.php?dir=StarBurst%2Fdata2sd%2F&amp;download=Data2SDInstallerX1.zip">Data2SDInstallerX1.zip</a>
    and
    <a href="http://www.droidzone.in/roms/index.php?dir=StarBurst%2Fdata2sd%2F&amp;download=Data2SDReInstallerX1.zip">Data2SDReInstallerX1.zip</a></li>
<li><strong>Google
    Apps</strong>: <a href="http://wiki.cyanogenmod.com/wiki/Latest_Version#Google_Apps">http://wiki.cyanogenmod.com/wiki/Latest_Version#Google_Apps</a></li>
<li><strong>GParted</strong>: you can use the version available on Ubuntu Linux or
    you can download a live Linux image with GParted
    installed: <a href="http://gparted.sourceforge.net/livecd.php">http://gparted.sourceforge.net/livecd.php</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Backup your data</h3>
<p>Before following these instructions, please <strong>do a complete backup</strong> of
your microSD, of your original ROM (using Nandroid or similar) ecc...</p>
<h3>Prepare the microSD card</h3>
<ul>
<li>Open GParted on your Ubuntu Linux or use the GParted Live CD/USB.</li>
<li>Delete all partitions on this microSD</li>
<li>Create the first one using FAT32 filesystem, leaving 2Gb
    (<strong>2047Mb</strong>) available at the end.</li>
<li>Create a second partition using <strong>ext4</strong> filesystem.</li>
<li>Confirm your changes</li>
<li>Copy CyanogenMod7 rom, Data2SD installers and Google Apps on FAT32
    partition</li>
</ul>
<h3>CyanogenMod 7 installation</h3>
<ul>
<li>Reboot your phone into <strong>Recovery</strong> (turn it off then press volume
    down + power)</li>
<li><strong>WIPE</strong> all data (userdata, cache ecc...)</li>
<li>Choose "Install from SD card" and select CyanogenMod7 installation
    zip</li>
<li>when finished reboot your phone</li>
<li>Enter your Wifi settings, language ecc.... <strong>DO NOT enter</strong> your
    Google account settings.</li>
<li>reboot your phone</li>
</ul>
<h3>Data2SD installation</h3>
<ul>
<li>Boot into <strong>Recovery</strong> again</li>
<li>Choose "Install from SD card" and select <strong>Data2SDInstallerX1.zip</strong>
    (please note, you may have to <strong>turn off the signature
    verification</strong> in Other-&gt;Turn off ecc...)</li>
<li>when finished reboot your phone</li>
<li>now you should see <strong>1,97Gb</strong> if you go in
    Settings-&gt;Storage-&gt;Internal Storage-&gt;Total space</li>
</ul>
<h3>Google Apps installation</h3>
<ul>
<li>Reboot your phone into Recovery</li>
<li>Choose "Install from SD card" and select the Google Apps zip file</li>
<li>reboot your phone</li>
</ul>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>You now have <strong>1,97Gb total space available</strong> instead of 148Mb. Enjoy
your HTC Desire!</p>
<h3><strong>Update Aug 1, 2012: since December 2011 I don't have an HTC Desire anymore. These informations could be still valid but in any other case I don't have the possibility to help you more.</strong></h3>
