<p>Even this morning I didn't wake up early because I still felt sick (I already
know this sore throath won't abandon me untile I go back home).</p>
<p>I had a <strong>light breakfast at 10:30</strong> and then I finishes uploading some
pictures and published articles on my blog I already had written before.</p>
<p>While waiting to attend a session, I found <strong>Mark Shuttleworth</strong> around
and I congratulated with him for the effort he is putting into Ubuntu.
Without a similar distribution, I'm pretty sure that Linux would not be
so popular today.</p>
<p>We had lunch at 13:00 as usual and after that I attended a couple of
presentation. The first one on Eucalyptus, then "<strong>Cooking Recipes</strong>"
for Ubuntu and another one dedicated to <strong>Wine</strong>. The Wine session was
so funny! They had a little problem with video projector and all the
images appeared with a blur effect so that you could think to be drunk
;)</p>
<p>After these sessions I had to go back to my room since I didn't feel
very well, but I was able to attend "<strong>Unity's relations and
dependancies on GNOME</strong>" thanks to audio streaming, IRC for asking
questions and etherpad to take notes.</p>
<p>I attended also "<strong>desktop-dx-o-unity-a11y</strong>" where there was a
discussion about the state of <strong>Unity</strong> and what can be improved before
<strong>Oneiric</strong> release. Lot of work has to be done yet, in particular about
accessibility.</p>
<p>Last session of this day, a
<strong><a href="http://summit.ubuntu.com/uds-o/meeting/other-o-sabdfl-community-qa/">Q+A</a></strong>
with <strong>Mark Shuttleworth</strong>. The session was very interesting! He replied
to all questions coming from the public and from IRC.</p>

<p>This day at UDS started a bit late for me, since i woke up pretty sick (damn
air conditioned!!!). I did not follow any conferences in the morning. I
relly wanted to follow the <strong>Wayland</strong> one, but when I arrived the room
was already full and it was almost impossible to enter, so I decided not
to enter.</p>
<p>I attended "<strong>What's wrong with UDS and how we can fix it</strong>" session
before having lunch. We discussed the possibility to improve all the
session in general,Â for example giving them a proper order so that a
team can first discuss some API interface, then another team can discuss
how to design them.</p>
<p>We had another wonderful and tasty <strong>lunch</strong>, even if I didn't eat so
much, but food was very good anyway.</p>
<p>During the afternoon I followed an interesting track: "<strong>Recommend music
based on current song playing or on users media library</strong>". We discussed
the possibilities to implement a music suggestion service, based on
user's tastes.</p>
<p>I spent the rest of theconference time writing these blog posts and
uploading pictures.</p>
<p>After the sessions we had the <strong>Linaro Showcase</strong>: lot of demo running
on Linaro and ARM processors. I was really impressed by a robot with
Kinect that was able to follow people recognizing their faces. During
the showcase there was a very nice dinner.</p>
<p>After dinner I went out with my friend <strong>Manrique Lopez</strong> who is here in
Budapest for another conference, so we decided to meet for a good beer.</p>
<p>Before coming back to the hotel me, <strong>Marco Trevisan</strong> and <strong>Andrea
Azzarone</strong> had a nice talk with <strong>Jorge Castro</strong>. He really make us feel
part of the Ubuntu family!</p>

<p>I left from <strong>Firenze</strong> with my friend <strong>Marco Trevisan</strong>, to go to
<strong><a href="http://uds.ubuntu.com">Ubuntu Developer Summit</a></strong> in <strong>Budapest</strong>. We
changed flight in <strong>Rome</strong> where we met also <strong>Andrea Azzarone</strong>.
Unluckly <strong>Alitalia losts Marco's baggage</strong>, so he's still waiting for
it.</p>
<p>We arrived at the hotel at 20:00 more or less where we met other people
of the community. There are <strong>lot of italians</strong> at UDS. Most work for
Canonical, other were sponsored by.</p>
<p>I met <strong>Marianna Raffaele</strong> (one of the UDS organizer... yeah, she's
italian too!), I had to explain her a little problem I had with my
booking (nothing bad) and she managed to help me. She also gave me a
very nice guitar plettre with Ubuntu logo. Thank you Marianna for this!</p>
<p>We went out with <strong>Jorge Castro</strong> to drink some beers (he offered me
one, thanks Jorge!!!) and we met lot of other Ubuntu people. A really
amazing start!</p>

<p>During next <a href="http://wiki.maemo.org/Maemo_Summit_2009"><strong>Maemo Summit</strong></a> we will have at least
2 hours (one on saturday and another one on sunday) of lightning talks,
about 20 talks where people will try to explain or present something in
just <strong>5 minutes</strong>.</p>
<p>Last year, during Maemo Summit 2008, I did a lightning talk too and I
must admit: even if I knew a lot about the subject of my talk and even
if I had already done many other talks, I think it wasn't so good as I
expected.</p>
<p>This year I've been selected again (more details will follow) to give a
5 minutes talk and with this great news the kind <a href="http://maemo.org/profile/view/dneary"><strong>Dave Neary</strong></a> also suggested me a
<a href="http://www.perl.com/pub/a/2004/07/30/lightningtalk.html">link</a> with an
article about some best practices when giving lightning talks. I'll try
to resume the most important points, hoping this will be useful for
people who is going to give a short presentation at Summit.</p>
<h2>Go straight to the point</h2>
<p>Five minutes finish sooner than you can
expect. You have to talk about the main topic of your talk within the
two first minutes, else you risk to talk too much about the rest and you
couldn't have the time for the most important thing.</p>
<h2>Leave details away</h2>
<p>People will never remember too many details
explained in so little time. It's better to leave them away and put them
in a more detailed blog post that you can link within your slides.</p>
<h2>Slides</h2>
<p>For a five minute talk you can avoid preparing slides, but
if this can help you to concentrate on points you have to talk about,
please prepare them. Two or three slides can be useful to introduce
yourself, to write any reference of what you're talking about many other
things. Another important thing, make sure your slides are ready before
starting your presentation: people don't want to wait 20-30 seconds it
takes to start Open Office or any other similar application.</p>
<h2>Consider any eventuality</h2>
<p>The presentation file could be damaged (be
sure to have a copy of it, better in PDF format), your laptop could have
no more battery (make sure you've a copy of your slides in a USB key),
aliens could take you away, ecc... (ok, this last eventuality is
remote).</p>
<h2>Concluding your talk</h2>
<p>Don't worry if you finish one or two minutes
before, people won't bother about it. It's better to finish one minute
before than 30 seconds later. If you want to leave an URL where people
can find more details, how to contact you, put it in every slide so
people will be able to take note of it from the first minute.</p>
<p>I hope to have resumed the most important points of the <a href="http://www.perl.com/pub/a/2004/07/30/lightningtalk.html">original article</a>.
If you think there are any other important things to say, please leave me a
comment and I'll add them. I really hope you will enjoy Maemo Summit and
its lightning talks!</p>
