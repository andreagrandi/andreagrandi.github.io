</footer><!-- /.post-info -->                <p>Few days ago I published <a href="http://www.andreagrandi.it/2010/02/17/nokia-n900-some-problems-with-latest-pr-1-1-1-firmware/">some
notes</a>
about my personal experience with <strong>PR 1.1.1</strong> firmware upgrade in Nokia
<strong>N900</strong>. In particular my device got an infinite reboot loop after
upgrading the firmware and I had to flash the firmware image from
scratch to fix the problem. Today I was kindly contacted by <strong>Max
Waterman</strong> (I suppose he works for Nokia) and he explained me what was
the problem. It was caused by a little bug in Harmattan UI demo and they
fixed it (the fix is already available in extras-devel).</p>
<p>No surprise for me: extras-devel contains unstable packages and if user
enables it, he does at his own risk. The most important thing is the
fact that the official firmware without any unstable application doesn't
suffer of this problem at all. The thing that really impressed me so
much (in a positive sense) it's that I was contacted privately by a
Nokia developer apologizing for the bug (no problem man, it's part of
the game if someone want to test extras-devel software) and explaining
that they already fixed it.</p>
<p>This is what I like of Maemo (or should I already call it MeeGo?), I
really feel to be a part of it!</p>

</footer><!-- /.post-info -->                <p>I don't know if it's just a case or if I'm the only one who had these
problems, but I'll report them anyway, maybe somebody had my same
problem and we could try to prepare a proper bug report to make the
Maemo team fix them.</p>
<h2>Infinite boot loop after upgrade</h2>
<p>First of all I have to say that before upgrading to PR 1.1.1 I checked
if I had enough space on the rootfs. I only had 27 Mb and so I decided
to remove some unused applications, deleted some *.deb in
/var/cache/apt/archives and disabled extras repositories. Of course I
also did a backup of all my configuration. After the cleaning operation
I had near 60 Mb free on rootfs, enough to install the upgrade.</p>
<p>I closed all running applications, started the application manager and
began the upgrade. After the upgrade was completed, the device did a
reboot... then another one, then again, again.... until I had to remove
the battery to stop it.</p>
<p>Conclusion: I had to re-flash the device with the latest image to make
it work again.</p>
<h2>mafw-dbus-wrapper taking all the CPU</h2>
<p>I was watching a video (using subtitles) and after some minutes the
whole UI became unresponsive. Strange because I already did this before
without having any problem. I tried to check the problem using "top"
utility from terminal and I saw that there was a mafw process
(mafw-dbus-wrapper) that was taking 80-90% of CPU. My fault is that
normally there are at least 3-4 , mafw-dbus-wrapper processes and I
didn't check which one was causing the problem. Anyway I made a
screenshot, just in case it can help.</p>

<p>I hope this short report can be useful to help Maemo team to fix or at
least investigate what happened. Just leave a comment or contact me if
you need more informations.</p>

</footer><!-- /.post-info -->                <p>Being one of the developers who received the discount to buy a N900,
during these days I contacted the DDP customer care to have more
informations and details. I'll publish here both my original question
and the official reply.</p>
<p><strong>1) The price of N900 is 250€ and I've read of people who paid it this
price. Anyway here you say that the VAT is not included:<br>
<a href="https://pro.forum.nokia.com/site/global/tech_resources/discounted_devices/l_ddp.jsp">https://pro.forum.nokia.com/site/global/tech_resources/discounted_devices/l_ddp.jsp</a><br>
so it should costs 300€ not 250€, right?</strong></p>
<p>The VAT applies only for Finnish developers, for the others the price is
the price they see in the eStore, no VAT is added to that.</p>
<p><em>So, all non-finnish european people, will pay <strong>250€</strong> for the N900.</em></p>
<p><strong>2) How much time can I wait before ordering it? In this moment I'm in
Valencia (Spain) and I won't come back to Italy before Christmas. I'd
like the order to be shipped to my home in Italy (I registered as
italian user and I want italian keyboard layout), but I'd like to wait
to order it, because since there's no warranty and I need to tell you
about any problem within a week, if I order it now I will be able to
check it only at the end of december when I'll come back to Italy.</strong></p>
<p>I guess this should not be a problem.</p>
<p><em>This part is not confirmed yet, since Quim told us to hurry up to buy
it.</em></p>
<p><strong>3) How many devices can I buy at that price? Here you say I can
buy two:<br>
<a href="https://pro.forum.nokia.com/site/global/tech_resources/discounted_devices/l_ddp.jsp">https://pro.forum.nokia.com/site/global/tech_resources/discounted_devices/l_ddp.jsp</a><br>
but here you say I can buy one:
<a href="https://pro.forum.nokia.com/showProduct.do?product_id=5096">https://pro.forum.nokia.com/showProduct.do?product_id=5096</a></p>
<p>I don't want two devices, but another friend of mine, who help me in a
project for the Maemo Community, would like to be able to buy one for
the same price (he wasn't able to get the discount because his karma is
still low).</strong></p>
<p>As far as I know, you can only purchase 1x device per person, regarding
MAEMO N900.</p>
<p><strong>4) Where can we find the new firmware? In the FAQ you say: DDP does
not flash devices. It's ok, I can do it, but there's no public firmware
for N900 at the moment.</strong></p>
<p>To update N900, can possibly be using NSU. Nokia software updater.</p>
<p><strong>5) Is it possible to have a device with localized keyboard (for
example italian one) ?</strong></p>
<p>All N900 will have EURO variant, Italian language is one option.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> even these replies come from the official customer care, I
don't assume any responsability if they shouldn't be all exact. If you
have any doubt, please contact them directly at
