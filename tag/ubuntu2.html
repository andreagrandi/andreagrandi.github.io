</footer><!-- /.post-info -->                <p>QtCreator is a very flexible IDE and can really be adapted for a lot of
things. I usually use it to develop mobile applications for Nokia N9 and
BlackBerry 10, but it can be used for more generic tasks. In my case I
wanted to be able to develop a Qt application using my desktop PC,
deploy it and run on a remote (actually it's on the same desk) Linux
machine running Xubuntu.</p>
<p>Doing this is quite easy and you don't need any specific plugin on
QtCreator, but be sure to have at least version 2.6.x. Other than
QtCreator you also need two Linux based PC (I used Ubuntu 12.10 for my
development machine and Xubuntu 12.10 for the remote netbook) and an SSH
account on the remote PC.</p>
<h3>Add the remote device to QtCreator</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.andreagrandi.it/images/2013/01/QtCreatorDevice.png"><img alt="QtCreatorDevice" src="https://www.andreagrandi.it/images/2013/01/QtCreatorDevice.png" width="100%"></a></p>
<p>To add the remote Linux device on QtCreator, use the
<strong>Tools-&gt;Options</strong> menu and click on "<strong>Devices</strong>" item. At this
point click on "<strong>Add</strong>" button and fill the fields using values similar
to the screenshot. In particular specify a <strong>name</strong> for the device, the
<strong>IP</strong> of the remote machine and a <strong>username</strong> and <strong>password</strong> that
must already exist (I just created the user "andrea" on the Xubuntu
machine and used the same password). I also had to set the <strong>timeout</strong>
to 20 seconds, because I had some connection problems and the connection
kept dropping after 10 seconds trying. To verify if everything is
working fine, just click on <strong>Test</strong> button.</p>
<h3>Add a specific Qt version</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.andreagrandi.it/images/2013/01/QtCreatorQtVersion.png"><img alt="QtCreatorQtVersion" src="https://www.andreagrandi.it/images/2013/01/QtCreatorQtVersion.png" width="100%"></a></p>
<p>To write your application you may need a specific Qt version that is
different from the one distributed by your Linux distribution. There's
no problem, QtCreator let you add different Qt versions without any
conflict. In my case I installed the Qt5 version distributed by
<strong>Canonical Qt5 Edgers
Team</strong>: <a href="https://launchpad.net/~canonical-qt5-edgers">https://launchpad.net/~canonical-qt5-edgers</a><br>
Once it's installed, just click on "<strong>Add</strong>" button and select the qmake
specific to the version you want to add (in my case it was in
<strong>/opt/qt5/bin/qmake</strong> ).</p>
<h3>Add a Qt Kit</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.andreagrandi.it/images/2013/01/QtCreatorQtKits.png"><img alt="QtCreatorQtKits" src="https://www.andreagrandi.it/images/2013/01/QtCreatorQtKits.png" width="100%"></a></p>
<p>QtCreator permits to add new <strong>Kit</strong> (development configurations) and
these kits are used during project creation to specify what you want to
target. In my example I added a new kit choosing an appropriate <strong>name</strong>
"Qt5 Ubuntu", the <strong>device type</strong>, the actual <strong>device</strong> previously
configured and finally the <strong>Qt version</strong> that we added before. With a
kit I have a complete "toolchain" that allow me to write applications
for a particular device, with a specific Qt version.</p>
<h3>Putting the pieces together</h3>
<p>At this point you just have to create a new "<strong>Qt Quick 2</strong>"
application, and select the new kit you just created instead of the
"Desktop" one. <strong>Please note</strong> that there is a little problem that I
haven't fixed yet (but I'm working on it): if you create, for example, a
project named "QtTest1" it will be deployed to the folder /opt/QtTest1/
on the remote machine. By default your user doesn't have read+write
permissions for that folder so I manualy created the folder and I gave a
chmod 777 on it, just for testing. There are two possible ways to fix
this: you could create a specific user that has read+write permissions
on /opt/ or you could modify the deployment configuration to have the
app deployed to the user /home (I will investigate on this possibility
and I will write something in one of the next posts).</p>
<h3>Final thoughts</h3>
<p>What all of this could be useful for? Well, do 2+2 and you'll easily
guess ;) In the next weeks I will post more specific informations and I
will update everyone with my progresses. Any comment is welcome! If you
want to contribute to this you're welcome too of course.</p>

</footer><!-- /.post-info -->                <p>During the last UDS party, I had an idea to improve Ubuntu development,
but I didn't know if it could be a good idea or a stupid one, so I
talked to <strong>Daniel Holbach</strong> and <strong>David Planella</strong> about it and they
were happy to hear about it and Daniel told me to talk about
this directly to <strong>Mark</strong> (and I did it).</p>
<p>Let's explain the basic idea.</p>
<p>From an UDS and the next one, it would be useful to have a
development sprint where people can talk about assigned UDS blueprints,
at which point they are on their tasks, if they have any problems and if
they will finish them within the next UDS.</p>
<p>Of course Canonical cannot organize another meeting, it would be
very expensive, so the idea is: why don't we use <strong>Google Hangout</strong> to
organize the sprint? I has a limit of 10 people, I know, but we could
select (for example) 5 from the community and 5 from Canonical. There
would be parallel meeting and tracks, we would use the same blueprints
used during the last UDS and we would add further notes. The
attendees would be able to listen and watch the stream and make
questions through the available chat.</p>
<p>I've also created a <strong>wiki</strong> page with more informations and you can
find it here: <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuReleaseSprint">https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuReleaseSprint</a></p>
<p>What do you think about? I know that Canonical is already
organizing sprints and this could be a way to involve more the Ubuntu
Community. Maybe we should schedule a session <strong>at next UDS</strong> to talk
about this?</p>
<p>I hope to get some <strong>feedback</strong> from you.</p>

<p>After upgrading my desktop PC to <strong>Ubuntu 12.04</strong> (actually my main
machine) I started experimenting many <strong>Xorg crashes</strong> and instability
issues. I <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/nvidia-graphics-drivers/+bug/986445">reported the
bug</a>,
but I had to find a solution or I should have rolled back to Ubuntu
11.10. The problem (from my point of view) is of the new <strong>Nvidia
295.40</strong> binary drivers. I also tried an older version (295.33)
experiencing the same problems. I then decided to give the
<strong><a href="http://nouveau.freedesktop.org">Nouveau</a></strong> opensource drivers a try.</p>
<p>I must say that in over 24 hours I didn't have a single Xorg crash. My
desktop is very stable and Nouveau drivers are pretty fast: I can watch
a 1080p video on Youtube in full screen without having any problem. The
only problem with my machine is that I'm using a VGA Switcher to share
my monitor wit Xbox (see <a href="http://www.andreagrandi.it/2012/02/26/sharing-your-pc-monitor-with-your-xbox-using-a-vga-switcher/">this old
post</a>),
so my monitor capabilities cannot be detected automatically and I had to
do some manually tuning of the Xorg configuration.</p>
<p>First of all I had to resolve a very annoying problem: the screen was
blinking every 10 seconds and this really hurted my eyes. To fix this I
had to add a kernel parameter: <strong>drm_kms_helper.poll=0<br>
</strong>you need to add this string in <strong>/etc/default/grub</strong> to
the <strong>GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT</strong> parameter. After this your line
should look like this one: <strong>GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash
drm_kms_helper.poll=0"</strong></p>
<p>Don't forget to execute: <strong>sudo update-grub</strong> from the command line.</p>
<p>Then I had to create a proper <strong>xorg.conf</strong> setting my resolution
(1680x1050) manually:</p>
<p>[sourcecode lang="text"]<br>
Section "Monitor"<br>
Identifier "DVI-I-1"<br>
VendorName "Asus"<br>
ModelName "Ancor Communications Inc VW222"<br>
Modeline "1680x1050R" 119.00 1680 1728 1760 1840 1050 1053 1059 1080
+hsync -vsync<br>
Option "PreferredMode" "1680x1050R"<br>
EndSection</p>
<p>Section "Screen"<br>
Identifier "Screen0"<br>
Monitor "DVI-I-1"<br>
EndSection<br>
[/sourcecode]</p>
<p>How do you generate the <strong>Modeline</strong> line? It's very simple. Just
execute: "<strong>cvt -r 1680 1050</strong>" in the command line and you'll get a
line similar to the one I added (of course substitute those numbers with
the resolution you want).</p>
<p>You have to save this file in <strong>/etc/X11/xorg.conf</strong> and reboot your
system to use all the new settings. Now my system runs nicely and very
fast! I'm really enjoying the new <strong>Ubuntu 12.04 Precise Pangolin</strong>. I
just hope that Nvidia guys will fix the sta<br>
bility issues of their driver as soon as possible, so I'll be able to
choose again between the opensource driver and the closed source one
(faster with 3D stuff, but more unstable as you can see).</p>
<p>A big <strong>thanks</strong> to everyone in <strong>#nouveau</strong> <strong>IRC</strong> channel on
<strong>Freenode</strong>. They were very kind to help me configuring their
opensource driver.</p>

Jam</a></strong> and about <strong>15 people</strong>
attended the event. We began with an introductive talk by <strong>Paolo
Sammicheli</strong> about the Italian Ubuntu Community and how it is possible
to contribute to Ubuntu. We divided in two small groups, one translating
from English to Italian (coordinated on IRC by the people of the
community) and another group leaded by <strong>Marco Trevisan</strong>, learning how
to implement automatic tests in Unity code (in particular he introduced
us <strong>Autopilot</strong>, more information
here: <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Unity/QA/Autopilot">https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Unity/QA/Autopilot</a> ). Next time I would
like to ask people to register to Launchpad and sign the Code of Conduct
<strong>before</strong> attending the global jam. We wasted a lot of time with this
task.</p>

<p>At the end of the day me and the other people from Pistoia, took the
other people for a quick tour around the city where we had the
possibility to eat some tasty food. It was a very amazing day and people
who started collaborating for the first time were very happy! I think
this has been a successful day, at least for us. I hope the other LoCo
are having a good Jam as well and I really can't wait for the next
Ubuntu Global Jam.</p>
