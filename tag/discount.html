</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>Being one of the developers who received the discount to buy a N900,
during these days I contacted the DDP customer care to have more
informations and details. I'll publish here both my original question
and the official reply.</p>
<p><strong>1) The price of N900 is 250€ and I've read of people who paid it this
price. Anyway here you say that the VAT is not included:<br>
<a href="https://pro.forum.nokia.com/site/global/tech_resources/discounted_devices/l_ddp.jsp">https://pro.forum.nokia.com/site/global/tech_resources/discounted_devices/l_ddp.jsp</a><br>
so it should costs 300€ not 250€, right?</strong></p>
<p>The VAT applies only for Finnish developers, for the others the price is
the price they see in the eStore, no VAT is added to that.</p>
<p><em>So, all non-finnish european people, will pay <strong>250€</strong> for the N900.</em></p>
<p><strong>2) How much time can I wait before ordering it? In this moment I'm in
Valencia (Spain) and I won't come back to Italy before Christmas. I'd
like the order to be shipped to my home in Italy (I registered as
italian user and I want italian keyboard layout), but I'd like to wait
to order it, because since there's no warranty and I need to tell you
about any problem within a week, if I order it now I will be able to
check it only at the end of december when I'll come back to Italy.</strong></p>
<p>I guess this should not be a problem.</p>
<p><em>This part is not confirmed yet, since Quim told us to hurry up to buy
it.</em></p>
<p><strong>3) How many devices can I buy at that price? Here you say I can
buy two:<br>
<a href="https://pro.forum.nokia.com/site/global/tech_resources/discounted_devices/l_ddp.jsp">https://pro.forum.nokia.com/site/global/tech_resources/discounted_devices/l_ddp.jsp</a><br>
but here you say I can buy one:
<a href="https://pro.forum.nokia.com/showProduct.do?product_id=5096">https://pro.forum.nokia.com/showProduct.do?product_id=5096</a></p>
<p>I don't want two devices, but another friend of mine, who help me in a
project for the Maemo Community, would like to be able to buy one for
the same price (he wasn't able to get the discount because his karma is
still low).</strong></p>
<p>As far as I know, you can only purchase 1x device per person, regarding
MAEMO N900.</p>
<p><strong>4) Where can we find the new firmware? In the FAQ you say: DDP does
not flash devices. It's ok, I can do it, but there's no public firmware
for N900 at the moment.</strong></p>
<p>To update N900, can possibly be using NSU. Nokia software updater.</p>
<p><strong>5) Is it possible to have a device with localized keyboard (for
example italian one) ?</strong></p>
<p>All N900 will have EURO variant, Italian language is one option.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> even these replies come from the official customer care, I
don't assume any responsability if they shouldn't be all exact. If you
have any doubt, please contact them directly at
