</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>Python 3.7.x introduced a <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.7.html#pep-553-built-in-breakpoint">new method to insert a breakpoint</a> in the code.
Before Python 3.7.x to insert a debugging point we had to write <code>import pdb; pdb.set_trace()</code> which honestly I could never remember (and I also created a snippet on VS Code to auto complete it).</p>
<p>Now you can just write <code>breakpoint()</code> that's it!</p>
<p>Now... the only problem is that by default that command will use <strong>pdb</strong> which is not exactly the best debugger you can have. I usually use <strong>ipdb</strong> but there wasn't an intuitive way of using it... and no, just installing it in your virtual environment, it won't be used by default.</p>
<p>How to use it then? It's very simple. The new debugging command will read an environment variable named <strong>PYTHONBREAKPOINT</strong>. If you set it properly, you will be able to use ipdb instead of pdb.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>export PYTHONBREAKPOINT=ipdb.set_trace
</pre></div>


<p>At this point, any time you use <code>breakpoint()</code> in your code, <strong>ipdb</strong> will be used instead of <strong>pdb</strong>.</p>

</footer><!-- /.post-info -->                <p>In the <a href="https://www.andreagrandi.it/2017/03/12/creating-a-production-ready-api-with-python-and-django-rest-framework-part-3/">previous
part</a>
of the tutorial we implemented <strong>details</strong> management, <strong>relations</strong>
between models, <strong>nested APIs</strong> and a different level of permissions.
Our API is basically complete but it is working properly? Is the source
code free of bugs? Would you feel confident to refactor the code without
breaking something? The answer to all our question is probably no. <strong>I
can't be sure if the code behaves properly nor I would feel confident
refactoring anything without having some tests coverage</strong>.</p>
<p>As I mentioned previously, we should have written tests since the
beginning, but I really didn't want to mix too many concepts together
and I wanted to let the user concentrate on the Rest Framework instead.</p>
<h3>Test structure and configuration</h3>
<p>Before beginning the fourth part of this tutorial, make sure you have
grabbed the latest source code
from <a href="https://github.com/andreagrandi/drf-tutorial">https://github.com/andreagrandi/drf-tutorial</a> and you have checked
out the previous git tag:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git checkout tutorial-1.14
</pre></div>


<p>Django has an integrated test runner but my personal choice is to use
<a href="https://doc.pytest.org/en/latest/"><strong>pytest</strong></a>, so as first thing let's
install the needed libraries:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>pip install pytest pytest-django
</pre></div>


<p>As long as we respect a minimum of conventions (test files must start
with <strong>test_</strong> prefix), tests can be placed anywhere in the code. My
advice is to put them all together in a separate folder and divide them
according to app names. In our case we are going to create a folder
named "<strong>tests</strong>" at the same level of <strong>manage.py</strong> file. Inside this
folder we need to create a <strong>__init__.py</strong> file and another folder
called <strong>catalog</strong> with an additional <strong>__init__.py</strong> inside. Now,
still at the same level of <strong>manage.py</strong> create a file called
<strong>pytest.ini</strong> with this content:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">pytest</span><span class="p">]</span>
<span class="n">DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">drftutorial</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">settings</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Are you feeling confused? No problem. You can checkout the source code
containing these changes.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git checkout tutorial-1.15
</pre></div>


<p>You can check if you have done everything correctly going inside the
drftutorial folder (the one containing <strong>manage.py</strong>) and launching
<strong>pytest</strong>. If you see something like this, you did your changes
correctly:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="o">(</span>drf-tutorial<span class="o">)</span> ➜  drftutorial git:<span class="o">(</span>master<span class="o">)</span> <span class="nv">pytest</span>

</pre></div>


<h3>Writing the first test</h3>
<p>To begin with, I will show you how to write a simple test that will
verify if the API can return the products list. If you remember we
implemented this API in the first part of the tutorial. First of all
create a file called <strong>test_views.py</strong> under the folder
<strong>drftutorial/tests/catalog/</strong> and add this code:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">pytest</span>
<span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">django.urls</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">reverse</span>
<span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">rest_framework</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">status</span>
<span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">rest_framework.test</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">APITestCase</span>


<span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">TestProductList</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">APITestCase</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="nd">@pytest.mark.django_db</span>
    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">test_can_get_product_list</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="n">url</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">reverse</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;product-list&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
        <span class="n">response</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">client</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">get</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">url</span><span class="p">)</span>
        <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">assertEqual</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">response</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">status_code</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">status</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">HTTP_200_OK</span><span class="p">)</span>
        <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">assertEqual</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">len</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">response</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">json</span><span class="p">()),</span> <span class="mi">8</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>before being able to run this test we need to change a little thing in
the <strong>catalog/urls.py</strong> file, something we should have done since the
beginning. Please change the first url in this way, adding the <strong>name</strong>
parameter:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">urlpatterns</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span>
    <span class="n">url</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="sa">r</span><span class="s1">&#39;^products/$&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">views</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">ProductList</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">as_view</span><span class="p">(),</span> <span class="n">name</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s1">&#39;product-list&#39;</span><span class="p">),</span>
    <span class="o">...</span>
</pre></div>


<p>at this point we are able to run our test suite again and verify the
test is passing:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="o">(</span>drf-tutorial<span class="o">)</span> ➜  drftutorial git:<span class="o">(</span>test-productlist<span class="o">)</span> ✗ pytest -v
<span class="o">=============================================================================================================================</span> <span class="nb">test</span> session <span class="nv">starts</span> <span class="o">==============================================================================================================================</span>

</pre></div>


<p>To checkout the source code at this point:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git checkout tutorial-1.16
</pre></div>


<h3>Explaining the test code</h3>
<p>When we implement a test, the first thing to do is to create a
<strong>test_*</strong> file and import the minimum necessary to write a test class
and method. Each test class must inherit from <strong>APITestCase</strong> and have a
name that start with <strong>Test</strong>, like <strong>TestProductList</strong>. Since we use
<a href="https://doc.pytest.org/en/latest/">pytest</a>, we need to mark our method
with <strong>@pytest.mark.django_db decorator</strong>, to tell the test suite our
code will explicitly access the database. We are going to use the <strong>client</strong> object
that is integrated in APITestCase to perform the request. Before doing that we
first get the local <strong>url</strong> using Django's <strong>reverse</strong> function. At this point
we do the call using the client:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">response</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">client</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">get</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">url</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>and then we assert a couple of things that we expect to be true:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">assertEqual</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">response</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">status_code</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">status</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">HTTP_200_OK</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">assertEqual</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">len</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">response</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">json</span><span class="p">()),</span> <span class="mi">8</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>We check that our API returns the <strong>200</strong> status code and that in the returned
JSON there are 8 elements.</p>
<p>It's normally a good practice to create test data inside the tests, but in our case
we previously created a data migration that creates test data. Migrations are
run every time we run tests so when we call our API, the data will be already there.</p>
<h3>Wrapping up</h3>
<p>I've written a <a href="https://github.com/andreagrandi/drf-tutorial/blob/master/drftutorial/tests/catalog/test_views.py">few tests</a> 
for all the views we have implemented until now and they are available
if you checkout this version of the code:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git checkout tutorial-1.17
</pre></div>


<p>I've only tested the views but it would be nice to test even the permission class, for example.
Please remember to write your tests first, if possible: implementing the code will be much more natural
once the tests are already in place.</p>

</footer><!-- /.post-info -->                <p>As you may have noticed, my website looks very different compared to a few days ago.
It's just a different theme or template, I completely changed how the pages are generated and
I'm hosting it in a completely different way.</p>
<h3>A brief history</h3>
<p>When I started this blog 10 years ago, I was hosting it on a shared hosting service and it was based on <strong>WordPress</strong>.
I then decided to keep WordPress as backend (I don't like PHP very much but I wasn't even good at front end development at the time,
so using a tool that allowed me to concentrate on the content rather than on design was a natural choice for me) but to move my website
to a <strong>VPS</strong> on <strong>DigitalOcean</strong>, where I've self-hosted <strong>Nginx + PHP + MySQL</strong> and even Postfix for email aliases until a few days ago.</p>
<h3>Why moving to a static website?</h3>
<p>In these three or four years I've been using a VPS, I must say I've been good enough (or maybe lucky?) at keeping "bad people" out
of my server, but it's true that <strong>maintaining a VPS can be very time consuming</strong> and you can never be sure that your website is always safe.
I've heard about static website before, but I was a bit skeptic because I had not spent enough time investigating all the possibilities
(search and comments are still possible, thanks to external services and plugins).</p>
<p>Another advantage of a static website is that I can perfectly "run" (preview) on my local computer without publishing it online. Pages can be rendered locally
and will appear in the browser exactly as they will appear once published online.</p>
<p>If you use a tool like WordPress, you need to be constantly connected to Internet to write any change. With static pages <strong>I can write my content offline</strong>
(so I can do it while commuting on the train or while I'm flying somewhere) and publish it once I'm back online.</p>
<h3>Pelican</h3>
<p>The tool that I'm using to generate this website is called <a href="https://blog.getpelican.com/">Pelican</a>. 
There are many <a href="https://www.staticgen.com/">static website generators</a>, the reason why I chose Pelican is because it's written in <strong>Python</strong>,
so if I need to do any change I can do them and because its templates use Jinja2 which I'm already familiar with. It can also import posts from WordPress
(and I had over 180 posts to import from my previous website) so if you are migrating from it it's a good choice. Please note that the import script is not perfect
and that you may have to adjust some formatting here and there.</p>
<h3>A new deployment pipeline</h3>
<p>When you use WordPress your website is already online and all you have to do is to login, use the integrated editor, write content and finally publish it.
A static website doesn't have any admin tool, it's just static pages. How do you publish content then? There are of course multiple solutions available.
In my case my website source code is hosted in <a href="https://github.com/andreagrandi/andreagrandi.it">a repository on GitHub</a>. When I commit on <strong>master</strong> branch
there is a webhook that triggers a <a href="https://github.com/andreagrandi/andreagrandi.it/blob/master/.travis.yml">build job</a> on <a href="https://travis-ci.org/">TravisCI</a>.
TravisCI fetches the latest source code, installs Pelican on the CI and builds the static pages. Once the build is finished, a <a href="https://github.com/andreagrandi/andreagrandi.it/blob/master/deploy.sh">bash script</a> is used to <strong>publish</strong>
the generated pages on the static website hosting service.</p>
<h3>Hosting a static website</h3>
<p>The good thing about hosting a static website is that you don't need a database so you can host it almost anywhere at a cheaper price or even for free.
In my case I've decided to use <strong>GitHub pages</strong>, mainly for simplicity. Every GitHub user can have a static website hosted at &lt;yourusername>.github.io for free.
To start using it, you just have to create a repository named &lt;yourusername>.github.io under your GitHub account. In my case the repository is <a href="https://github.com/andreagrandi/andreagrandi.github.io">https://github.com/andreagrandi/andreagrandi.github.io</a>. My deploy script simply takes the generated content
that is in the output/ folder and <strong>git push</strong> it on this repository. Once the website has been pushed to git, it's immediately available at <strong>https://andreagrandi.github.io</strong></p>

<p>GitHub Pages service has a little limitation: you can either have your website served from a URL similar to the one I've just mentioned, including SSL support <em>or</em> you can use your own domain, but <strong>you can't have both things</strong> (SSL + custom domain). To workaround this, you can instruct your domain registrar (in my case is <a href="https://www.gandi.net/">Gandi.net</a>) to let CloudFlare manage your domain and just enabling "Full SSL" support will do the trick. I won't repeat here how to use CloudFlare since they have a very nice tutorial explaining how to configure their service to be used with GitHub Pages: <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/secure-and-fast-github-pages-with-cloudflare/">https://blog.cloudflare.com/secure-and-fast-github-pages-with-cloudflare/</a>. Remember to include a <strong>CNAME</strong> file containing your domain name and let your static generetor put it on the root of your website, otherwise GitHub pages won't serve the pages correctly.</p>
<h4>Why not Amazon S3?</h4>
<p>While I was looking for instructions about how to host a static websites, I found many examples of websites using Amazon S3. There is nothing wrong with using this service (just keep in mind that it's not free, Amazon charges you for space usage and requests, so keep an eye on the AWS bill) but the way these websites were using it was completely wrong. The most common error I noticed was the fact they were enabling the <strong>flexible SSL</strong> option on CloudFlare: this means that the connection between the visitor and CloudFlare was encrypted (and visitor could see the the SSL enabled) but the connection between CloudFlare and Amazon S3 was being served with <strong>HTTP only</strong>, meaning that potentially the pages could have been modified before being served. Infact Amazon doesn't serve the S3 website buckets with SSL, they use plain HTTP (Why are you doing this Amazon?!). To use the S3 bucket correctly one should also configure Route 53 (to manage DNS) and CloudFront (the Amazon equivalent of CloudFlare service, beware because this is also charged separately depending on usage/traffic), making the whole setup a bit more complicated.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>I finally moved away from my VPS and from now on I will be able to concentrate my time on content only instead of spending part of it to maintain my server. Last but not least, the possibility to write my content offline, will hopefully allow me to write from places (train, airplane) where I've never written from before. If you have any suggestion or if if you notice any error, feel free to leave a comment here below. In alternative, since now this blog is completely open source and on GitHub, you can fork it and make a pull request!</p>
