</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>Before I start, let me confirm to you that official
<a href="https://www.docker.com/"><strong>Docker</strong></a> images for
<a href="http://www.postgresql.org/"><strong>PostgreSQL</strong></a> already exist and are
available here: <a href="https://registry.hub.docker.com/_/postgres/">https://registry.hub.docker.com/_/postgres/</a> so this
howto wants to be a guide to explain how to create these images and talk
about some of the Docker features.</p>
<p>I will assume that you have already installed Docker on your machine. I
have tested these instructions both on <strong>Ubuntu Linux</strong> and <strong>OSX</strong> (OSX
users will need to install <a href="http://boot2docker.io/">boot2docker</a>,
instructions are not available in this guide).</p>
<h2>Dockerfile</h2>
<p>To create a Docker image we need to create a text file named
<strong>Dockerfile</strong> and use the available commands and syntax to declare how
the image will be built. At the beginning of the file we need to specify
the base image we are going to use and our contact informations:</p>
<p>``` {.theme:github .decode-attributes:false .tab-convert:true .lang:default .decode:true}
FROM ubuntu:14.04
MAINTAINER Andrea Grandi <a href="&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;&#110;&#111;&#115;&#112;&#97;&#109;&#116;&#104;&#97;&#110;&#107;&#115;&#64;&#103;&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;">&#110;&#111;&#115;&#112;&#97;&#109;&#116;&#104;&#97;&#110;&#107;&#115;&#64;&#103;&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;</a></p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>In our case we are using **Ubuntu 14.04** as base image. After these
instructions we need to add PostgreSQL package repository and GnuPG
public key:

``` {.theme:github .decode-attributes:false .lang:default .decode:true}
RUN apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys B97B0AFCAA1A47F044F244A07FCC7D46ACCC4CF8
RUN echo &quot;deb http://apt.postgresql.org/pub/repos/apt/ precise-pgdg main&quot; &gt; /etc/apt/sources.list.d/pgdg.list
</pre></div>


<p>then we need to update the packages available in Ubuntu and install
PostgreSQL:</p>
<p>``` {.theme:github .decode-attributes:false .lang:default .decode:true}
RUN apt-get update &amp;&amp; apt-get -y -q install python-software-properties software-properties-common <br>
   &amp;&amp; apt-get -y -q install postgresql-9.3 postgresql-client-9.3 postgresql-contrib-9.3</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>We are installing version 9.3 of PostgreSQL, instructions would be very
similar for any other version of the database.

**Note:** it&#39;s important to have **apt-get update** and **apt-get
install** commands in the same **RUN** line, else they would be
considered two different layers by Docker and in case an updated package
is available it won&#39;t be installed when the image is rebuilt.

At this point we switch to **postgres** user to execute the next
commands:

``` {.theme:github .lang:default .decode:true}
USER postgres
RUN /etc/init.d/postgresql start   
   &amp;&amp; psql --command &quot;CREATE USER pguser WITH SUPERUSER PASSWORD &#39;pguser&#39;;&quot;   
   &amp;&amp; createdb -O pguser pgdb
</pre></div>


<p>We switch to <strong>root</strong> user and we complete the configuration:</p>
<p>``` {.theme:github .lang:default .decode:true}
USER root
RUN echo "host all  all    0.0.0.0/0  md5" &gt;&gt; /etc/postgresql/9.3/main/pg_hba.conf
RUN echo "listen_addresses='*'" &gt;&gt; /etc/postgresql/9.3/main/postgresql.conf</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>We expose the port where PostgreSQL will listen to:

``` {.theme:github .lang:default .decode:true}
EXPOSE 5432
</pre></div>


<p>We setup the data and shared folders that we will use later:</p>
<p>``` {.theme:github .lang:default .decode:true}
RUN mkdir -p /var/run/postgresql &amp;&amp; chown -R postgres /var/run/postgresql
VOLUME  ["/etc/postgresql", "/var/log/postgresql", "/var/lib/postgresql"]</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Finally we switch again to the **postgres** user and we define the entry
command for this image:

``` {.theme:github .lang:default .decode:true}
USER postgres
CMD [&quot;/usr/lib/postgresql/9.3/bin/postgres&quot;, &quot;-D&quot;, &quot;/var/lib/postgresql/9.3/main&quot;, &quot;-c&quot;, &quot;config_file=/etc/postgresql/9.3/main/postgresql.conf&quot;]
</pre></div>


<p>The full <strong>Dockerfile</strong> is available
here <a href="https://github.com/andreagrandi/postgresql-docker/blob/master/Dockerfile">https://github.com/andreagrandi/postgresql-docker/blob/master/Dockerfile</a></p>
<h2>Building Docker image</h2>
<p>Once the Dockerfile is ready, we need to build the image before running
it in a container. Please customize the tag name using your own
docker.io hub account (or you won't be able to push it to the hub):</p>
<p>``` {.theme:github .lang:default .decode:true}
docker build --rm=true -t andreagrandi/postgresql:9.3 .</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="gh">Running the PostgreSQL Docker container</span>
<span class="gh">---------------------------------------</span>

To run the container, once the image is built, you just need to use this
command:

<span class="s">``` {.theme:github .lang:default .decode:true}</span>
<span class="s">docker run -i -t -p 5432:5432 andreagrandi/postgresql:9.3</span>
</pre></div>


<h2>Testing the running PostgreSQL</h2>
<p>To test the running container we can use any client, even the
commandline one:</p>
<p>``` {.theme:github .lang:default .decode:true}
psql -h localhost -p 5432 -U pguser -W pgdb</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>When you are prompted for password, type: **pguser**  
Please note that **localhost** is only valid if you are running Docker
on Ubuntu. If you are an OSX user, you need to discover the correct ip
using: **boot2docker ip**

Persisting data
---------------

You may have noticed that once you stop the container, if you previously
wrote some data on the DB, that data is lost. This is because by default
Docker containers are not persistent. We can resolve this problem using
a data container. My only suggestion is not to do it manually and use a
tool like [**fig**](http://www.fig.sh/) to orchestrate this. Fig is a
tool to orchestrate containers and its features are being rewritten in
Go language and integrated into Docker itself. So if you prepare a
**fig.yml** configuration file now, you will be able, hopefully, to
reuse it once this feature will be integrated into Docker. Please refer
to fig website for the instructions to install it (briefly: under Ubuntu
you can use **pip install fig** and under OSX you can use **brew install
fig**).

``` {.theme:github .lang:default .decode:true}
dbdata:
  image: andreagrandi/postgresql:9.3
  volumes:
    - /var/lib/postgresql
  command: true

db:
  image: andreagrandi/postgresql:9.3
  volumes_from:
    - dbdata
  ports:
    - &quot;5432:5432&quot;
</pre></div>


<p>Save this file as <strong>fig.yml</strong> in the same folder of the Dockerfile and
spin up the container using this command: <strong>fig up</strong></p>
<p><code>{.theme:github .lang:default .decode:true}
andreas-air:postgresql-docker andrea [master] $ fig up

<p>If you try to write some data on the database and then you stop (CTRL+C)
the running containers and spin up them again, you will see that your
data is still there.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>This is just an example of how to prepare a Docker container for a
specific service. The difficoult part is when you have to spin up
multiple services (for example a Django web application using
PostgreSQL, RabbitMQ, MongoDB etc...), connect them all together and
orchestrate the solution. I will maybe talk about this in one of the
next posts. You can find the full source code of my PostgreSQL Docker
image, including the fig.yml file in this

</footer><!-- /.post-info -->                <p>When last week <a href="http://fridge.ubuntu.com/2013/02/26/ubuntu-developer-summits-now-online-and-every-three-months/">Canonical
announced</a>
the usual UDS was not going to happen I was a bit shocked and
disappointed: starting from the next UDS (that is going to happen
tomorrow!) the event will be <strong>online only</strong> and <strong>every 3 months</strong>.
During these days I've been thinking a lot about this move and I will
tell you what are the pros and cons, in my opinion, followed by some
final thoughts.</p>
<h2>Pros</h2>
<p>Having 4 UDS every year, instead of 2, is surely a better thing. I'm a
big fan of Scrum methodology, so I think that <strong>iterating more often is
better</strong> than iterating less. If there are any mistakes you can correct
them and iterating again before releasing the final product.</p>
<p>Potentially <strong>more people can partecipate</strong> to the event (even the
opposite is true and I will explain why). People won't need to move from
home, travel, pay any expense etc... they just need a computer and a
good Internet connection.</p>
<p>It's <strong>cheaper for everyone</strong>: I can just imagine how expensive could be
for Canonical to organize a similar event. Booking a big hotel, paying
travel and expenses to near one houndred of community people. People who
didn't get any sponsorization had to pay all the travel expenses to
attend the event.</p>
<h2>Cons</h2>
<p>Potentially <strong>less people can partecipate</strong> to the event. Yes, like I
said before even this sentence is true and I will explain why. First of
all, using Google+ there are at least three countries that will be cut
out: <strong>China</strong>, <strong>Thailand</strong> and <strong>Vietnam</strong>. Google+ is not available
in those countries.</p>
<p>Are you sure that special people will be able to follow the event? For
example <strong>blind people</strong> won't be able to chat or to ask question in the
chat.</p>
<p><strong>Only 10 people</strong> will be able to talk. In normal UDS sessions more
people could raise the hand and ask a question or interact with the
track leaders. Who will choose the 10 people with audio+video streaming
rights?</p>
<p>We will <strong>completly miss the social aspect</strong> of the UDS. If you think
this was only a secondary part, please go on. I felt more committed to
work and collaborate with people I met in person than with someone I've
never met before.</p>
<p>Announcing an event, even if online, just <strong>one week before</strong> it
happens. Really? Some people had already taken vacation from work,
booked flights etc... not counting many people that can't take 2 days
off from work just with 1 week notice period. It's also almost
impossible that community members have the time to schedule a blueprint
and be able to discuss about a subject.</p>
<h2>Final thoughts</h2>
<p>From a <strong>cutting costs</strong> point of view I really can't say anything.
Organizing UDS was surely very expensive for Canonical and nobody can
blame them if they decided to spend those money in a different way.</p>
<p>What really concerns me: is UDS still useful? My opinion is that at
least since latest 2 or 3 UDS the presence of the Community was not so
relevant, because I had <strong>the clear sensation that the most important
decisions were made by Canonical before the UDS</strong> and then there was
just some details tuning. Another proof of my thoughts is the today
announcement: <strong>despite the fact that I 100% agree with Unity switching
to Qt/QML</strong> (I already proposed this 2 years ago during Budapest UDS,
but nobody listened to me) <strong>I completly disagree with the way the
decision was made</strong>: not a single involvement or discussion with the
community.</p>
<p>I would apreaciate <strong>more openness and honesty</strong> from Canonical. Do you
want to take all the decisions? That's fine, but at least state it
clearly.</p>

</footer><!-- /.post-info -->                <p>QtCreator is a very flexible IDE and can really be adapted for a lot of
things. I usually use it to develop mobile applications for Nokia N9 and
BlackBerry 10, but it can be used for more generic tasks. In my case I
wanted to be able to develop a Qt application using my desktop PC,
deploy it and run on a remote (actually it's on the same desk) Linux
machine running Xubuntu.</p>
<p>Doing this is quite easy and you don't need any specific plugin on
QtCreator, but be sure to have at least version 2.6.x. Other than
QtCreator you also need two Linux based PC (I used Ubuntu 12.10 for my
development machine and Xubuntu 12.10 for the remote netbook) and an SSH
account on the remote PC.</p>
<h2 id="add-the-remote-device-to-qtcreator" style="text-align: left;">Add the remote device to QtCreator</h2>
<p><img alt="QtCreatorDevice" src="http://www.andreagrandi.it/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/QtCreatorDevice.png">{.aligncenter
.wp-image-748 width="488" height="282"}</p>
<p>To add the remote Linux device on QtCreator, use the
<strong>Tools-&gt;Options</strong> menu and click on "<strong>Devices</strong>" item. At this
point click on "<strong>Add</strong>" button and fill the fields using values similar
to the screenshot. In particular specify a <strong>name</strong> for the device, the
<strong>IP</strong> of the remote machine and a <strong>username</strong> and <strong>password</strong> that
must already exist (I just created the user "andrea" on the Xubuntu
machine and used the same password). I also had to set the <strong>timeout</strong>
to 20 seconds, because I had some connection problems and the connection
kept dropping after 10 seconds trying. To verify if everything is
working fine, just click on <strong>Test</strong> button.</p>
<h2>Add a specific Qt version</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.andreagrandi.it/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/QtCreatorQtVersion.png"><img alt="QtCreatorQtVersion" src="http://www.andreagrandi.it/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/QtCreatorQtVersion.png">{.aligncenter
.size-full .wp-image-754 width="488"
height="282"}</a></p>
<p>To write your application you may need a specific Qt version that is
different from the one distributed by your Linux distribution. There's
no problem, QtCreator let you add different Qt versions without any
conflict. In my case I installed the Qt5 version distributed by
<strong>Canonical Qt5 Edgers
Team</strong>: <a href="https://launchpad.net/~canonical-qt5-edgers">https://launchpad.net/~canonical-qt5-edgers</a><br>
Once it's installed, just click on "<strong>Add</strong>" button and select the qmake
specific to the version you want to add (in my case it was in
<strong>/opt/qt5/bin/qmake</strong> ).</p>
<h2>Add a Qt Kit</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.andreagrandi.it/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/QtCreatorQtKits.png"><img alt="QtCreatorQtKits" src="http://www.andreagrandi.it/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/QtCreatorQtKits.png">{.aligncenter
.size-full .wp-image-757 width="488"
height="282"}</a></p>
<p>QtCreator permits to add new <strong>Kit</strong> (development configurations) and
these kits are used during project creation to specify what you want to
target. In my example I added a new kit choosing an appropriate <strong>name</strong>
"Qt5 Ubuntu", the <strong>device type</strong>, the actual <strong>device</strong> previously
configured and finally the <strong>Qt version</strong> that we added before. With a
kit I have a complete "toolchain" that allow me to write applications
for a particular device, with a specific Qt version.</p>
<h2>Putting the pieces together</h2>
<p>At this point you just have to create a new "<strong>Qt Quick 2</strong>"
application, and select the new kit you just created instead of the
"Desktop" one. <strong>Please note</strong> that there is a little problem that I
haven't fixed yet (but I'm working on it): if you create, for example, a
project named "QtTest1" it will be deployed to the folder /opt/QtTest1/
on the remote machine. By default your user doesn't have read+write
permissions for that folder so I manualy created the folder and I gave a
chmod 777 on it, just for testing. There are two possible ways to fix
this: you could create a specific user that has read+write permissions
on /opt/ or you could modify the deployment configuration to have the
app deployed to the user /home (I will investigate on this possibility
and I will write something in one of the next posts).</p>
<h2>Final thoughts</h2>
<p>What all of this could be useful for? Well, do 2+2 and you'll easily
guess ;) In the next weeks I will post more specific informations and I
will update everyone with my progresses. Any comment is welcome! If you
want to contribute to this you're welcome too of course.</p>

this morning I didn't wake up early because I still felt sick (I already
know this sore throath won't abandon me untile I go back home).</p>
<p>I had a <strong>light breakfast at 10:30</strong> and then I finishes uploading some
pictures and published articles on my blog I already had written before.</p>
<p>While waiting to attend a session, I found <strong>Mark Shuttleworth</strong> around
and I congratulated with him for the effort he is putting into Ubuntu.
Without a similar distribution, I'm pretty sure that Linux would not be
so popular today.</p>
<p>We had lunch at 13:00 as usual and after that I attended a couple of
presentation. The first one on Eucalyptus, then "<strong>Cooking Recipes</strong>"
for Ubuntu and another one dedicated to <strong>Wine</strong>. The Wine session was
so funny! They had a little problem with video projector and all the
images appeared with a blur effect so that you could think to be drunk
;)</p>
<p>After these sessions I had to go back to my room since I didn't feel
very well, but I was able to attend "<strong>Unity's relations and
dependancies on GNOME</strong>" thanks to audio streaming, IRC for asking
questions and etherpad to take notes.</p>
<p>I attended also "<strong>desktop-dx-o-unity-a11y</strong>" where there was a
discussion about the state of <strong>Unity</strong> and what can be improved before
<strong>Oneiric</strong> release. Lot of work has to be done yet, in particular about
accessibility.</p>
<p>Last session of this day, a
<strong><a href="http://summit.ubuntu.com/uds-o/meeting/other-o-sabdfl-community-qa/">Q+A</a></strong>
with <strong>Mark Shuttleworth</strong>. The session was very interesting! He replied
to all questions coming from the public and from IRC.</p>
