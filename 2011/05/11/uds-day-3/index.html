<meta name="description" content="Even this morning I didn&#39;t wake up early because I still felt sick (I already know this sore throath won&#39;t abandon me untile I go back home). I had a light breakfast at 10:30 and then I finishes uploading some pictures and published articles on my blog I already had written before. While waiting to attend a session, I found Mark Shuttleworth around and I congratulated with him for the effort he is putting into Ubuntu. Without a similar distribution, I&#39;m pretty sure that Linux would not be so popular today. We had lunch at 13:00 as usual and after that I attended a couple of presentation. The first one on Eucalyptus, then &#34;Cooking Recipes&#34; for Ubuntu and another one dedicated to Wine. The Wine session was so funny! They had a little problem with video projector and all the images appeared with a blur effect so that you could think to be drunk ;) After these sessions I had to go back to my room since I didn&#39;t feel very well, but I was able to attend &#34;Unity&#39;s relations and dependancies on GNOME&#34; thanks to audio streaming, IRC for asking questions and etherpad to take notes. I attended also &#34;desktop-dx-o-unity-a11y&#34; where there was a discussion about the state of Unity and what can be improved before Oneiric release. Lot of work has to be done yet, in particular about accessibility. Last session of this day, a Q+A with Mark Shuttleworth. The session was very interesting! He replied to all questions coming from the public and from IRC." />
