this morning I didn't wake up early because I still felt sick (I already
know this sore throath won't abandon me untile I go back home).</p>
<p>I had a <strong>light breakfast at 10:30</strong> and then I finishes uploading some
pictures and published articles on my blog I already had written before.</p>
<p>While waiting to attend a session, I found <strong>Mark Shuttleworth</strong> around
and I congratulated with him for the effort he is putting into Ubuntu.
Without a similar distribution, I'm pretty sure that Linux would not be
so popular today.</p>
<p>We had lunch at 13:00 as usual and after that I attended a couple of
presentation. The first one on Eucalyptus, then "<strong>Cooking Recipes</strong>"
for Ubuntu and another one dedicated to <strong>Wine</strong>. The Wine session was
so funny! They had a little problem with video projector and all the
images appeared with a blur effect so that you could think to be drunk
;)</p>
<p>After these sessions I had to go back to my room since I didn't feel
very well, but I was able to attend "<strong>Unity's relations and
dependancies on GNOME</strong>" thanks to audio streaming, IRC for asking
questions and etherpad to take notes.</p>
<p>I attended also "<strong>desktop-dx-o-unity-a11y</strong>" where there was a
discussion about the state of <strong>Unity</strong> and what can be improved before
<strong>Oneiric</strong> release. Lot of work has to be done yet, in particular about
accessibility.</p>
<p>Last session of this day, a
<strong><a href="http://summit.ubuntu.com/uds-o/meeting/other-o-sabdfl-community-qa/">Q+A</a></strong>
with <strong>Mark Shuttleworth</strong>. The session was very interesting! He replied
to all questions coming from the public and from IRC.</p>
