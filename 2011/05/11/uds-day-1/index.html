day started at 7:30 with a <strong>very nice breakfast!</strong> I was alone with
just another guy this morning, in a very big breakbast room.</p>
<p>After it I grabbed my badge to avoid queue later and went back to my
room to wake up <strong>Marco Trevisan</strong> (he was still sleeping :P ).</p>
<p>The keynote was opened by <strong>Jono Bacon</strong> (the Ubuntu Community manager),
followed by Ubuntu founder <strong>Mark Shuttleworth</strong>. The most interesting
(and tweeted) part of the keynote was "<strong>how to prounounce Oneiric</strong>"
(Oeniric will be the next Ubuntu release).</p>
<p>The keynote finished with a bit late, so all the other tracks were
shifted forward. I followed "<strong>Unity 2D Oneiric Improvements</strong>", it was
interesting because there were some <strong>Nokia/Qt</strong> guys and they looked
very interested in helping the Unity 2D team and collaborating with
them.</p>
<p>Now following "<strong><a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DocumentationTeam/SystemDocumentation/Tasks/Oneiric">Shaping a strategy for Ubuntu user
assistance</a></strong>",
I just had the possibility my involvement into helping people that
require Ubuntu assistance.</p>
<p>The <strong>lunch</strong> has been very tasty, I had the possibility to eat some
local recipes, not bad at all.</p>
<p>After lunch we had a short session on <strong>Qt</strong>. The version 4.8 is going
to be released in a couple of months, while 5.0 is announced to be
released in 1 year from now: it will be almost code-compatible with 4.x,
it will have an improved support for Qt Quick and QML.</p>
<p>As last track of the day I decided to follow "<strong>Personal Cloud</strong>". Not a
perfect track, since the person who should have been here was only
talking with us using Skype and it was more difficoult to hear what he
said.</p>
<p>At the end of this day there was the "<strong>Meet &amp; Greet</strong>" party, sponsored
by Freescale and Openstack. They offered a dinner and we had some good
music after it.</p>
