<meta name="description" content="{.alignright .size-medium .wp-image-528 width=&#34;240&#34; height=&#34;160&#34;}My day started at 7:30 with a very nice breakfast! I was alone with just another guy this morning, in a very big breakbast room. After it I grabbed my badge to avoid queue later and went back to my room to wake up Marco Trevisan (he was still sleeping :P ). The keynote was opened by Jono Bacon (the Ubuntu Community manager), followed by Ubuntu founder Mark Shuttleworth. The most interesting (and tweeted) part of the keynote was &#34;how to prounounce Oneiric&#34; (Oeniric will be the next Ubuntu release). The keynote finished with a bit late, so all the other tracks were shifted forward. I followed &#34;Unity 2D Oneiric Improvements&#34;, it was interesting because there were some Nokia/Qt guys and they looked very interested in helping the Unity 2D team and collaborating with them. Now following &#34;Shaping a strategy for Ubuntu user assistance&#34;, I just had the possibility my involvement into helping people that require Ubuntu assistance. The lunch has been very tasty, I had the possibility to eat some local recipes, not bad at all. After lunch we had a short session on Qt. The version 4.8 is going to be released in a couple of months, while 5.0 is announced to be released in 1 year from now: it will be almost code-compatible with 4.x, it will have an improved support for Qt Quick and QML. As last track of the day I decided to follow &#34;Personal Cloud&#34;. Not a perfect track, since the person who should have been here was only talking with us using Skype and it was more difficoult to hear what he said. At the end of this day there was the &#34;Meet &amp; Greet&#34; party, sponsored by Freescale and Openstack. They offered a dinner and we had some good music after it." />
