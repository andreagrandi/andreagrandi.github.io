<meta name="description" content="{.alignright .size-medium .wp-image-531 width=&#34;240&#34; height=&#34;160&#34;}This day at UDS started a bit late for me, since i woke up pretty sick (damn air conditioned!!!). I did not follow any conferences in the morning. I relly wanted to follow the Wayland one, but when I arrived the room was already full and it was almost impossible to enter, so I decided not to enter. I attended &#34;What&#39;s wrong with UDS and how we can fix it&#34; session before having lunch. We discussed the possibility to improve all the session in general, for example giving them a proper order so that a team can first discuss some API interface, then another team can discuss how to design them. We had another wonderful and tasty lunch, even if I didn&#39;t eat so much, but food was very good anyway. During the afternoon I followed an interesting track: &#34;Recommend music based on current song playing or on users media library&#34;. We discussed the possibilities to implement a music suggestion service, based on user&#39;s tastes. I spent the rest of theconference time writing these blog posts and uploading pictures. After the sessions we had the Linaro Showcase: lot of demo running on Linaro and ARM processors. I was really impressed by a robot with Kinect that was able to follow people recognizing their faces. During the showcase there was a very nice dinner. After dinner I went out with my friend Manrique Lopez who is here in Budapest for another conference, so we decided to meet for a good beer. Before coming back to the hotel me, Marco Trevisan and Andrea Azzarone had a nice talk with Jorge Castro. He really make us feel part of the Ubuntu family!" />
