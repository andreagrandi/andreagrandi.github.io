<meta content="This day at UDS started a bit late for me, since i woke up pretty sick (damn air conditioned!!!). I did not follow any conferences in the morning. I relly wanted to follow the Wayland one, but when I arrived the room was already full and it was almost impossible to enter, so I decided not to enter. I attended &quot;What's wrong with UDS and how we can fix it&quot; session before having lunch. We discussed the possibility to improve all the session in general, for example giving them a proper order so that a team can first discuss some API interface, then another team can discuss how to design them. We had another wonderful and tasty lunch, even if I didn't eat so much, but food was very good anyway. During the afternoon I followed an interesting track: &quot;Recommend music based on current song playing or on users media library&quot;. We discussed the possibilities to implement a music suggestion service, based on user's tastes. I spent the rest of theconference time writing these blog posts and uploading pictures. After the sessions we had the Linaro Showcase: lot of demo running on Linaro and ARM processors. I was really impressed by a robot with Kinect that was able to follow people recognizing their faces. During the showcase there was a very nice dinner. After dinner I went out with my friend Manrique Lopez who is here in Budapest for another conference, so we decided to meet for a good beer. Before coming back to the hotel me, Marco Trevisan and Andrea Azzarone had a nice talk with Jorge Castro. He really make us feel part of the Ubuntu family!" name="description">

<p>This day at UDS started a bit late for me, since i woke up pretty sick (damn
air conditioned!!!). I did not follow any conferences in the morning. I
relly wanted to follow the <strong>Wayland</strong> one, but when I arrived the room
was already full and it was almost impossible to enter, so I decided not
to enter.</p>
<p>I attended "<strong>What's wrong with UDS and how we can fix it</strong>" session
before having lunch. We discussed the possibility to improve all the
session in general,Â for example giving them a proper order so that a
team can first discuss some API interface, then another team can discuss
how to design them.</p>
<p>We had another wonderful and tasty <strong>lunch</strong>, even if I didn't eat so
much, but food was very good anyway.</p>
<p>During the afternoon I followed an interesting track: "<strong>Recommend music
based on current song playing or on users media library</strong>". We discussed
the possibilities to implement a music suggestion service, based on
user's tastes.</p>
<p>I spent the rest of theconference time writing these blog posts and
uploading pictures.</p>
<p>After the sessions we had the <strong>Linaro Showcase</strong>: lot of demo running
on Linaro and ARM processors. I was really impressed by a robot with
Kinect that was able to follow people recognizing their faces. During
the showcase there was a very nice dinner.</p>
<p>After dinner I went out with my friend <strong>Manrique Lopez</strong> who is here in
Budapest for another conference, so we decided to meet for a good beer.</p>
<p>Before coming back to the hotel me, <strong>Marco Trevisan</strong> and <strong>Andrea
Azzarone</strong> had a nice talk with <strong>Jorge Castro</strong>. He really make us feel
part of the Ubuntu family!</p>
