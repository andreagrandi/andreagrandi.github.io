</footer><!-- /.post-info -->                <p>Developing Python applications sometimes it's useful to be able to test
the code with different environments, for example a particular version
of Python or a specific Django version etc... Setting up many different
virtual machines would be really too much work and even using a chroot
environment is not what you need in some cases. Thanks to
<a href="https://github.com/pypa/virtualenv"><strong>virtualenv</strong></a> is it possible to
create a self contained Python environment with all the specific
libraries you may need. Using virtualenv is very easy:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creating the virtual environment: <strong>virtualenv
    myenvÂ --no-site-packages</strong></li>
<li>Entering the virtual environment: <strong>source myenv/bin/activate</strong></li>
<li>Deactivating the virtual environment: <strong>deactivate</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>That's it! Once you're inside the virtual environment you will be using
the Python libraries inside it. I suggest you to install all the Python
libraries you need using <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip"><strong>pip</strong></a>.</p>

</footer><!-- /.post-info -->                <p>When last week <a href="http://fridge.ubuntu.com/2013/02/26/ubuntu-developer-summits-now-online-and-every-three-months/">Canonical
announced</a>
the usual UDS was not going to happen I was a bit shocked and
disappointed: starting from the next UDS (that is going to happen
tomorrow!) the event will be <strong>online only</strong> and <strong>every 3 months</strong>.
During these days I've been thinking a lot about this move and I will
tell you what are the pros and cons, in my opinion, followed by some
final thoughts.</p>
<h2>Pros</h2>
<p>Having 4 UDS every year, instead of 2, is surely a better thing. I'm a
big fan of Scrum methodology, so I think that <strong>iterating more often is
better</strong> than iterating less. If there are any mistakes you can correct
them and iterating again before releasing the final product.</p>
<p>Potentially <strong>more people can partecipate</strong> to the event (even the
opposite is true and I will explain why). People won't need to move from
home, travel, pay any expense etc... they just need a computer and a
good Internet connection.</p>
<p>It's <strong>cheaper for everyone</strong>: I can just imagine how expensive could be
for Canonical to organize a similar event. Booking a big hotel, paying
travel and expenses to near one houndred of community people. People who
didn't get any sponsorization had to pay all the travel expenses to
attend the event.</p>
<h2>Cons</h2>
<p>Potentially <strong>less people can partecipate</strong> to the event. Yes, like I
said before even this sentence is true and I will explain why. First of
all, using Google+ there are at least three countries that will be cut
out: <strong>China</strong>, <strong>Thailand</strong> and <strong>Vietnam</strong>. Google+ is not available
in those countries.</p>
<p>Are you sure that special people will be able to follow the event? For
example <strong>blind people</strong> won't be able to chat or to ask question in the
chat.</p>
<p><strong>Only 10 people</strong> will be able to talk. In normal UDS sessions more
people could raise the hand and ask a question or interact with the
track leaders. Who will choose the 10 people with audio+video streaming
rights?</p>
<p>We will <strong>completly miss the social aspect</strong> of the UDS. If you think
this was only a secondary part, please go on. I felt more committed to
work and collaborate with people I met in person than with someone I've
never met before.</p>
<p>Announcing an event, even if online, just <strong>one week before</strong> it
happens. Really? Some people had already taken vacation from work,
booked flights etc... not counting many people that can't take 2 days
off from work just with 1 week notice period. It's also almost
impossible that community members have the time to schedule a blueprint
and be able to discuss about a subject.</p>
<h2>Final thoughts</h2>
<p>From a <strong>cutting costs</strong> point of view I really can't say anything.
Organizing UDS was surely very expensive for Canonical and nobody can
blame them if they decided to spend those money in a different way.</p>
<p>What really concerns me: is UDS still useful? My opinion is that at
least since latest 2 or 3 UDS the presence of the Community was not so
relevant, because I had <strong>the clear sensation that the most important
decisions were made by Canonical before the UDS</strong> and then there was
just some details tuning. Another proof of my thoughts is the today
announcement: <strong>despite the fact that I 100% agree with Unity switching
to Qt/QML</strong> (I already proposed this 2 years ago during Budapest UDS,
but nobody listened to me) <strong>I completly disagree with the way the
decision was made</strong>: not a single involvement or discussion with the
community.</p>
<p>I would apreaciate <strong>more openness and honesty</strong> from Canonical. Do you
want to take all the decisions? That's fine, but at least state it
clearly.</p>

</footer><!-- /.post-info -->                <p>I've decided to write this post as a note to myself. I'm still learning
Node.js and digging into Express/Jade, but I've read many people using
the nice <a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/"><strong>Twitter Bootstrap</strong></a>
and I was wondering if there was a way to integrate all these
technologies. The short answer is: yes, we can!</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> once again, I'm not a Node.js expert and surely there are
other ways to achieve this task (for example there is a Node.js module
called
<a href="https://npmjs.org/package/twitter-bootstrap"><strong>twitter-bootstrap</strong></a>,
but I haven't tried it). This tutorial is based on another tutorial I
found, but it was not very updated and it had a more complicated way to
install Bootstrap, so I decided to write a new one basing it on the
originalÂ <a href="http://www.rs.au.com/31/how-to-install-bootstrap-v2-0-2-in-expressjs-v3-0-0">http://www.rs.au.com/31/how-to-install-bootstrap-v2-0-2-in-expressjs-v3-0-0</a></p>
<h2>Preparing the environment</h2>
<p>I will assume that you're running any Linux distribution (in my case I'm
using Ubuntu 12.10, but feel free to use your own distribution). Be sure
to have installed a recent version of <strong>nodejs</strong> and <strong>npm</strong> packages
(I'm using Node.js 0.8.20 and npm 1.2.11).</p>
<h3>Create a project folder and install the required dependencies</h3>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>mkdir node-bootstrap
cd node-bootstrap
npm install express
npm install jade
</pre></div>


<h2>Create the basic project structure with Express</h2>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>andrea@andrea-Inspiron-660:~/Documents/sviluppo/nodejs/node-bootstrap$ node_modules/express/bin/express nodebootstrap

create : nodebootstrap
create : nodebootstrap/package.json
create : nodebootstrap/app.js
create : nodebootstrap/public
create : nodebootstrap/public/javascripts
create : nodebootstrap/public/images
create : nodebootstrap/public/stylesheets
create : nodebootstrap/public/stylesheets/style.css
create : nodebootstrap/routes
create : nodebootstrap/routes/index.js
create : nodebootstrap/routes/user.js
create : nodebootstrap/views
create : nodebootstrap/views/layout.jade
create : nodebootstrap/views/index.jade

install dependencies:
$ cd nodebootstrap &amp;&amp; npm install

run the app:
$ node app
</pre></div>


<p>You should already have installed all the needed dependencies, even
without executing <strong>npm install</strong>, anyway executing it won't hurt.</p>
<h2>Download and install Bootstrap</h2>
<p>Download Twitter Boostrap from the official
websiteÂ <a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/assets/bootstrap.zip">http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/assets/bootstrap.zip</a> and
unzip it under theÂ <strong>nodebootstrap/public</strong> folder.</p>
<h2>Bootstrap integration with Jade template system</h2>
<p>At this point you need to edit the <strong>views/layout.jade</strong> file and
include the references to Bootsrap</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>!!!
html
  head
    title= title
    link(rel=&#39;stylesheet&#39;, href=&#39;/bootstrap/css/bootstrap.min.css&#39;)
    link(rel=&#39;stylesheet&#39;, href=&#39;/bootstrap/css/bootstrap-responsive.min.css&#39;)
    link(rel=&#39;stylesheet&#39;, href=&#39;/stylesheets/style.css&#39;)
    script(src=&#39;https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1/jquery.min.js&#39;)
    script(src=&#39;/bootstrap/js/bootstrap.min.js&#39;)
  body
    block content
</pre></div>


<p>Test the Bootstrap integration</p>
<p>At this point we will modify <strong>views/index.jade</strong> that is the default
template used to render the index</p>
<p>extends layout</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>block content
  div.top
    form.form-horizontal(method=&quot;post&quot;, id=&quot;loginForm&quot;)
      label Username
      input.span3(id=&quot;username&quot;, type=&quot;text&quot;, name=&quot;User&quot;, placeholder=&quot;Enter your username&quot;)
      label Password
      input.span3(id=&quot;password&quot;, type=&quot;password&quot;, name=&quot;Password&quot;)
      input.btn(type=&quot;submit&quot;, value=&quot;Log In&quot;)
  div.container
    div.content
      table.table.table-striped
        thead
          tr
            th Table
            th Heading
        tbody
          tr
            td Blah
            td Test
          tr
            td Hello
            td World

  div.footer
</pre></div>


<p>Now go back to the terminal and execute the app:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>andrea@andrea-Inspiron-660:~/Documents/sviluppo/nodejs/node-bootstrap/nodebootstrap$ node app.js
Express server listening on port 3000
</pre></div>


<p>Open your favourite browse and visit <a href="http://localhost:3000">http://localhost:3000</a> to see your
first Bootstrap + Node.js application app and running.</p>

</footer><!-- /.post-info -->                <p>Developing CuteSoma and maintaining it for three different platforms
(Nokia N9, Windows Phone, BlackBerry 10) is really taking me a lot of
time. I've many features in mind to add but I can't dedicate much spare
time to them and to do it I should take time from other paid projects.
I've also discarded the idea to make CuteSoma a paid app, because it's
been always free (except the Windows Phone one that was non-free for
just a month, but only 6 people "SIX" bought the app).</p>
<p>So I decided to open a <a href="http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/cutesoma-soma-fm-client/x/2353169">fundraising
campaign</a>
on
<a href="http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/cutesoma-soma-fm-client/x/2353169"><strong>Indiegogo</strong></a>
that is a service like <strong>KickStarter</strong>, but it's available all around
the world (not just in USA and UK like Kickstarter).</p>
<h3>What do I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I would like to raise at least <strong>5.000â¬</strong> to be able to keep maintaining
the existing features and to implement new one. Developing for 3
different platforms really takes a lot of time. I also need to find a
way to get a Windows Phone 8 device because at the moment I cannot test
some features using just the emulator.</p>
<p>What the application currently does:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can view the list of Soma.fm channels</li>
<li>You can listen any channel</li>
</ul>
<p>Features I would like to add:</p>
<ul>
<li>Scrobbling song to Last.fm</li>
<li>Write a new MediaSource for Windows Phone (the default one is quite
    bugged and I need to implement one from scratch)</li>
<li>Port the BlackBerry10 version to the native CascadesUI</li>
</ul>
<div>

### The Impact

Funding the development of CuteSoma you will make thousands of people
really happy, because they will be able to listen to Soma.fm on their
Nokia N9, Windows Phone and BlackBerry 10 devices. You will also make me
feel apreciated for all the hours I'm spending to write the code :)

</div>

<div>

### Completly Opensource

Yes. CuteSoma is completlyÂ **opensource**. I keep my source code on
GitHub and BitBucket and it's always updated. All the CuteSoma versions
are released under theÂ **GPL license**.
