</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>I must admit it, there was a time when I was not using <strong>HTTPS</strong>, not
even to protect the admin section of the website. This means that anyone
could have intercepted the password and published (or deleted) things in
my name. Since a couple of years ago I started protecting my admin
sectio using an SSL certificate.  I haven't done it before for a couple
of reason: my hosting was on a provider that required a lot of money
(something like 100\$/year) to enable SSL support, plus an SSL
certificated costed at least 100-120\$/year.</p>
<p>When I migrated my website on my own <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=cc8349e328a5">VPS on
DigitalOcean</a> I
finally discovered that <strong><a href="https://www.startssl.com">StartSSL</a></strong> was
giving <strong>free class 1 certificates</strong> and I immediately got one. I made
the mistake to just serve the admin pages using HTTPS, not all the
website. I regretted about this decision after readin a
<a href="http://dannyman.toldme.com/2010/12/23/swa-yahoo-being-evil/">couple</a> of
<a href="http://opensource.com/business/15/8/interview-daniel-roesler-utilityapi">articles</a>
that were explaining how some internet providers where changing served
HTTP pages injecting their own ads or banner. That was unacceptable to
me and I swicthed the whole website to HTTPS.</p>
<p>Basically, if you don't serve even your personal website using HTTPS,
someone could change the page while it's being transfered to the
requester. Imagine if you have (like me) a page on your blog that let
people download your public PGP key. Users could be served with a
different key, so someone else would be able to decrypt a message
intended for you only. Scary, isn't it?</p>
<p>If you need more informations about how to request a StartSSL
certificate and how to install it on Nginx/Apache, I can suggest this
nice tutorial: <a href="https://konklone.com/post/switch-to-https-now-for-free">https://konklone.com/post/switch-to-https-now-for-free</a></p>
<p>If you need to serve a WordPress website, that configuration is not
enough. In that case you may want to have a look at my own Nginx
configuration, available at this
address: <a href="https://gist.github.com/andreagrandi/5de9dc9c4eb7e732764c">https://gist.github.com/andreagrandi/5de9dc9c4eb7e732764c</a></p>

<strong>10\$ credit</strong> (enough for 2 months if you choose the basic droplet)
for <strong>free, u</strong>se this link and enjoy
