&lt;p&gt;﻿We have &lt;strong&gt;315&lt;/strong&gt; registrants as of today for the conference, so numbers
are looking good without having any agenda published yet! A good portion
of sessions should be approved by April 8th, this Friday and you will
receive an email when/if your session has been approved yet. Not all the
sessions will be approved by Friday though so if you do not hear from
the committee then do not worry they are probably just working through
it. The program committee is tenatively planning to have a first draft
of the Agenda up by April 15th. &lt;strong&gt;Sponsored Travel attendees&lt;/strong&gt; should
start receiving approvals during next week and approvals will continue
through April 25th.&lt;/p&gt;

event as planned. Program contains keynotes, three tracks, meegathon
competition, AR.Drone fun, evening party, Intel AppUp Lab, BoFs and
more. &lt;a href="http://summit.meegonetwork.fi"&gt;http://summit.meegonetwork.fi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Interest towards summit has been huge, beyond our expectations. We were
fully booked after one week. We have \~350 participants (limited by
facilities and other details), over 140 are (still) in queue for
cancellation seat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;MeeGo Corporate Guidelines and Regional and Local Assets and Guidelines&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We in conjunction with Jarkko and the Finland team, the many
contributors from the community, the Linux foundation, the events team,
and the Caffelli design team have pulled together the guidelines for
MeeGo Events. Thank you all for your contributions in putting these
together! The Guidelines and Collateral Assets are posted on the Event's
page at &lt;a href="http://wiki.meego.com/Events#MeeGo_Conferences"&gt;http://wiki.meego.com/Events#MeeGo_Conferences&lt;/a&gt; we would like
your feedback and input so please email me &lt;strong&gt;amy.l.leeland@intel.com&lt;/strong&gt;
please send us things that you think we missed or things we could change
to make the guidelines better.&lt;/p&gt;
