Nokia N9) has been available for 4 months now and it's the right time to
publish some interesting statistics about downloads. First of all I
didn't expect so much interest and I wasn't sure to have so many
downloads, due to the fact that Nokia never advertised this device
properly. But luckly lot of people don't care about advertising and buy
a product anyway if they know it's one of the best available on the
smartphone market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm really happy to notice that the number of downloads is growing each
month, this motivates me to continue with development (well... when my
N950 comes back from Nokia, since I had to send it because it was
broken).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to thank all the &lt;strong&gt;3658&lt;/strong&gt; people that downloaded CuteSoma until
now and all the people that are sending me their feedback, ideas and
patches (yes &lt;strong&gt;Cornelius Hald&lt;/strong&gt;, I'm talking about you :D ) you're
giving me a big opportunity to learn &lt;strong&gt;C++/Qt/QML&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
