day started at 7:30 with a &lt;strong&gt;very nice breakfast!&lt;/strong&gt; I was alone with
just another guy this morning, in a very big breakbast room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After it I grabbed my badge to avoid queue later and went back to my
room to wake up &lt;strong&gt;Marco Trevisan&lt;/strong&gt; (he was still sleeping :P ).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The keynote was opened by &lt;strong&gt;Jono Bacon&lt;/strong&gt; (the Ubuntu Community manager),
followed by Ubuntu founder &lt;strong&gt;Mark Shuttleworth&lt;/strong&gt;. The most interesting
(and tweeted) part of the keynote was "&lt;strong&gt;how to prounounce Oneiric&lt;/strong&gt;"
(Oeniric will be the next Ubuntu release).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The keynote finished with a bit late, so all the other tracks were
shifted forward. I followed "&lt;strong&gt;Unity 2D Oneiric Improvements&lt;/strong&gt;", it was
interesting because there were some &lt;strong&gt;Nokia/Qt&lt;/strong&gt; guys and they looked
very interested in helping the Unity 2D team and collaborating with
them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now following "&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DocumentationTeam/SystemDocumentation/Tasks/Oneiric"&gt;Shaping a strategy for Ubuntu user
assistance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;",
I just had the possibility my involvement into helping people that
require Ubuntu assistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;lunch&lt;/strong&gt; has been very tasty, I had the possibility to eat some
local recipes, not bad at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After lunch we had a short session on &lt;strong&gt;Qt&lt;/strong&gt;. The version 4.8 is going
to be released in a couple of months, while 5.0 is announced to be
released in 1 year from now: it will be almost code-compatible with 4.x,
it will have an improved support for Qt Quick and QML.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As last track of the day I decided to follow "&lt;strong&gt;Personal Cloud&lt;/strong&gt;". Not a
perfect track, since the person who should have been here was only
talking with us using Skype and it was more difficoult to hear what he
said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of this day there was the "&lt;strong&gt;Meet &amp;amp; Greet&lt;/strong&gt;" party, sponsored
by Freescale and Openstack. They offered a dinner and we had some good
music after it.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">admin</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 11 May 2011 11:05:00 +0100</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:www.andreagrandi.it,2011-05-11:/2011/05/11/uds-day-1/</guid><category>Ubuntu (EN), UDS</category><category>Budapest</category><category>Canonical</category><category>conference</category><category>Ubuntu</category><category>UDS</category></item><item><title>UDS day-0</title><link>https://www.andreagrandi.it/2011/05/11/uds-day-0/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.andreagrandi.it/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/IMG_0254.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://www.andreagrandi.it/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/IMG_0254-300x200.jpg" title="IMG_0254"&gt;{.alignright
.size-medium .wp-image-523 width="210"
height="140"}&lt;/a&gt;I
left from &lt;strong&gt;Firenze&lt;/strong&gt; with my friend &lt;strong&gt;Marco Trevisan&lt;/strong&gt;, to go to
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://uds.ubuntu.com"&gt;Ubuntu Developer Summit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; in &lt;strong&gt;Budapest&lt;/strong&gt;. We
changed flight in &lt;strong&gt;Rome&lt;/strong&gt; where we met also &lt;strong&gt;Andrea Azzarone&lt;/strong&gt;.
Unluckly &lt;strong&gt;Alitalia losts Marco's baggage&lt;/strong&gt;, so he's still waiting for
it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We arrived at the hotel at 20:00 more or less where we met other people
of the community. There are &lt;strong&gt;lot of italians&lt;/strong&gt; at UDS. Most work for
Canonical, other were sponsored by.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I met &lt;strong&gt;Marianna Raffaele&lt;/strong&gt; (one of the UDS organizer... yeah, she's
italian too!), I had to explain her a little problem I had with my
booking (nothing bad) and she managed to help me. She also gave me a
very nice guitar plettre with Ubuntu logo. Thank you Marianna for this!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We went out with &lt;strong&gt;Jorge Castro&lt;/strong&gt; to drink some beers (he offered me
one, thanks Jorge!!!) and we met lot of other Ubuntu people. A really
amazing start!&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">admin</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 11 May 2011 10:40:00 +0100</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:www.andreagrandi.it,2011-05-11:/2011/05/11/uds-day-0/</guid><category>Ubuntu (EN), UDS</category><category>Budapest</category><category>conference</category><category>summit</category><category>Ubuntu</category><category>UDS</category></item><item><title>Giving Lightning Talks</title><link>https://www.andreagrandi.it/2009/09/03/giving-lightning-talks/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="lightning" src="http://www.andreagrandi.it/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/lightning.jpg" title="lightning"&gt;{.alignright
.size-full .wp-image-320 width="131" height="183"}During next &lt;a href="http://wiki.maemo.org/Maemo_Summit_2009"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maemo
Summit&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; we will have at least
2 hours (one on saturday and another one on sunday) of lightning talks,
about 20 talks where people will try to explain or present something in
just &lt;strong&gt;5 minutes&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, during Maemo Summit 2008, I did a lightning talk too and I
must admit: even if I knew a lot about the subject of my talk and even
if I had already done many other talks, I think it wasn't so good as I
expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year I've been selected again (more details will follow) to give a
5 minutes talk and with this great news the kind &lt;a href="http://maemo.org/profile/view/dneary"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dave
Neary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; also suggested me a
&lt;a href="http://www.perl.com/pub/a/2004/07/30/lightningtalk.html"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt; with an
article about some best practices when giving lightning talks. I'll try
to resume the most important points, hoping this will be useful for
people who is going to give a short presentation at Summit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Go straight to the point:&lt;/strong&gt; five minutes finish sooner than you can
expect. You have to talk about the main topic of your talk within the
two first minutes, else you risk to talk too much about the rest and you
couldn't have the time for the most important thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leave details away:&lt;/strong&gt; people will never remember too many details
explained in so little time. It's better to leave them away and put them
in a more detailed blog post that you can link within your slides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Slides:&lt;/strong&gt; for a five minute talk you can avoid preparing slides, but
if this can help you to concentrate on points you have to talk about,
please prepare them. Two or three slides can be useful to introduce
yourself, to write any reference of what you're talking about many other
things. Another important thing, make sure your slides are ready before
starting your presentation: people don't want to wait 20-30 seconds it
takes to start Open Office or any other similar application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consider any eventuality:&lt;/strong&gt; the presentation file could be damaged (be
sure to have a copy of it, better in PDF format), your laptop could have
no more battery (make sure you've a copy of your slides in a USB key),
aliens could take you away, ecc... (ok, this last eventuality is
remote).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Concluding your talk:&lt;/strong&gt; don't worry if you finish one or two minutes
before, people won't bother about it. It's better to finish one minute
before than 30 seconds later. If you want to leave an URL where people
can find more details, how to contact you, put it in every slide so
people will be able to take note of it from the first minute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope to have resumed the most important points of the &lt;a href="http://www.perl.com/pub/a/2004/07/30/lightningtalk.html"&gt;original
article&lt;/a&gt;. If
you think there are any other important things to say, please leave me a
comment and I'll add them. I really hope you will enjoy Maemo Summit and
its lightning talks!&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">admin</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 03 Sep 2009 17:21:00 +0100</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:www.andreagrandi.it,2009-09-03:/2009/09/03/giving-lightning-talks/</guid><category>Igalia, Maemo (EN)</category><category>amsterdam</category><category>conference</category><category>lightning</category><category>maemo</category><category>nokia</category><category>summit</category><category>talk</category></item><item><title>PyMaemo Talk on May 10th in Florence at PyCon2 Conference</title><link>https://www.andreagrandi.it/2008/04/09/pymaemo-talk-on-may-10th-in-florence-at-pycon2-conference/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;[PyCon2]{style="font-weight: bold;"} is the second edition of the
