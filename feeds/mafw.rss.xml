&lt;p&gt;The PyMaemo team is currently working on writing bindings for Python&lt;br&gt;
language for this library and at the moment we've released a 0.1&lt;br&gt;
version of python-mafw that you can install directly from Scratchbox&lt;br&gt;
repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not all the methods are implemented (you can manage the Registry and&lt;br&gt;
the Playlist, but nothing more), because even if we're using codegen&lt;br&gt;
to generate bindings (and it's helping us a lot), we've seen that at&lt;br&gt;
least 30-40 methods have to be overridden by hand so it's taking us&lt;br&gt;
more time than we expected and we're trying to organize how to&lt;br&gt;
continue this work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We would like to get feedback from python application developers and&lt;br&gt;
also from C application developers that are currently using MAFW so we&lt;br&gt;
can work on a "roadmap" that reflects what developers want:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are the functionalities you're using in your application that
    you think they cannot miss in the Python binding?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have you already started using MAFW or even better python-mafw to
    develop something?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is the currently missing method/methods you would like to be
    implemented first?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Come on developers! We're waiting for your feedback :)&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Andrea Grandi</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 05 Aug 2009 10:16:00 +0200</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:www.andreagrandi.it,2009-08-05:/2009/08/05/mafw-and-python-asking-for-developers-feedback/</guid><category>Igalia, Linux, Maemo (EN), Programmazione, Python</category><category>bindings</category><category>fremantle</category><category>maemo</category><category>mafw</category><category>Python</category></item></channel></rss>
