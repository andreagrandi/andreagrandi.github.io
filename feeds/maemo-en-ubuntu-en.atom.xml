&lt;p&gt;After a very pleasant experience in &lt;strong&gt;Finland (Tampere)&lt;/strong&gt;, I've finally
come back to Italy. I had the opportunity to work for three months in
&lt;strong&gt;Nokia&lt;/strong&gt; as "&lt;em&gt;Qt Expert&lt;/em&gt;" in "&lt;em&gt;Nokia Developer Forum&lt;/em&gt;" and it's been an
amazing job!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be more precise I left Finland on August 31th, but I didn't have much
time to blog about this. Finally I can use my desktop PC again and I'm
not anymore limited to my small netbook. Trust me... spending 3 months
with a 11'' netbook and pretending to work normally is really
frustrating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I have more spare time (too much :\ ) to contribute to Ubuntu and
to play with some new technologies: I'm working on a project that uses
&lt;strong&gt;Arduino&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Android&lt;/strong&gt; and some "robotic" parts, with people of
&lt;a href="http://www.ptlug.org"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pistoia Linux User Group&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and it's really an
amazing learning experience!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talking about Ubuntu, if you have never contributed to it and you would
like to start with something easy, I suggest you this interesting
initiative &lt;a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuDevelopment/BugFixingInitiative"&gt;https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuDevelopment/BugFixingInitiative&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the mean time I'm also looking for new opportunities and challenges
(aka = looking for a new job), so if you think you may be interested in
me, take a couple of minutes to give a look to my LinkedIn
profile &lt;a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/andreagrandi"&gt;http://www.linkedin.com/in/andreagrandi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will attend next &lt;strong&gt;UDS&lt;/strong&gt; in &lt;strong&gt;Copenaghen&lt;/strong&gt; (99% sure) and I already
have a couple of topics I would like to work with, but I will talk about
these later, first I want to properly create a blueprint in Launchpad so
we will have a starting point.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://www.andreagrandi.it/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Tampere2.jpg" title="Tampere2"&gt;{.alignleft
