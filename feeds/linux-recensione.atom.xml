.size-medium .wp-image-336 width="168" height="164"}As many of you
already know, &lt;strong&gt;Fon&lt;/strong&gt; is a spanish company that some years ago had the
interesting idea of creating a &lt;strong&gt;wifi community&lt;/strong&gt; to share the Internet
connection. The idea is quite simple: each "fonero" buy a Fonera (the
router sold by Fon), register it on the Fon system and get a
username/password. If the fonero travels around the world he's able to
connect to wifi signal of other foneras and browse the web for free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I bought my first fonera few years ago, I was one of the first
people in my city. I bought it because I was really beliving in this
project. During these years Fon produced new models of fonera and I
bought each of them (the WRT54 router, Fonera, Fonera+, Fonera 2.0g,
Fonera 2.0n ecc....). Since first year, the Fon community has grown a
lot and now there are a lot of foneros around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Actual situation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Few months ago Fon launched a very interesting product: &lt;strong&gt;Fonera 2.0g&lt;/strong&gt;.
Thats's not only a router. Fonera 2 is capable of managing torrents,
rapidshare downloads, uploading photo on Facebook and Flickr, and much
more. Whats's wrong with this product? It's &lt;strong&gt;very unstable&lt;/strong&gt;! There are
a lot of users that bought this router when it was anounced and they're
still waiting for a lot of bugs to be fixed by Fon developers team
(composed by only ONE person!). Why users had to wait so long?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simple! They were working to Fonera 2.0n! Wow! Faster router, more RAM,
4 ethernet port, wonderful! But... another very unstable router! And
with unstable I mean: it &lt;strong&gt;disconnects/reboots often&lt;/strong&gt;, connection is
unstable, applications don't work ecc.... I'm talking about a 79€
router, not about something that users had as preview product. Me and
other users were still waiting for an uograde when... Fon &lt;a href="http://english.martinvarsavsky.net/general/fon-to-unveil-new-fonera-at-mobile-world-congress.html"&gt;announced a
new
product&lt;/a&gt;!
Yes, another one!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fon priority is not to fix a product that thousand of users have already
bought. Fon priority is to produce and sell a new product!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It could be only my opinion, but I don't trust you anymore Fon! I'm
really disappointed about your behaviour you had with your customers.
I've already spent (wasted) a lot of money with your not-working
products and I'm not going to buy your products anymore! I'm tired of
being illuded by your promises: how long are you going to play tricks on
users?&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="fon"></category><category term="fonera"></category><category term="foneros"></category><category term="Linux"></category><category term="router"></category><category term="wifi"></category></entry></feed>
