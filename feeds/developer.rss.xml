this morning I didn't wake up early because I still felt sick (I already
know this sore throath won't abandon me untile I go back home).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had a &lt;strong&gt;light breakfast at 10:30&lt;/strong&gt; and then I finishes uploading some
pictures and published articles on my blog I already had written before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While waiting to attend a session, I found &lt;strong&gt;Mark Shuttleworth&lt;/strong&gt; around
and I congratulated with him for the effort he is putting into Ubuntu.
Without a similar distribution, I'm pretty sure that Linux would not be
so popular today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had lunch at 13:00 as usual and after that I attended a couple of
presentation. The first one on Eucalyptus, then "&lt;strong&gt;Cooking Recipes&lt;/strong&gt;"
for Ubuntu and another one dedicated to &lt;strong&gt;Wine&lt;/strong&gt;. The Wine session was
so funny! They had a little problem with video projector and all the
images appeared with a blur effect so that you could think to be drunk
;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After these sessions I had to go back to my room since I didn't feel
very well, but I was able to attend "&lt;strong&gt;Unity's relations and
dependancies on GNOME&lt;/strong&gt;" thanks to audio streaming, IRC for asking
questions and etherpad to take notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I attended also "&lt;strong&gt;desktop-dx-o-unity-a11y&lt;/strong&gt;" where there was a
discussion about the state of &lt;strong&gt;Unity&lt;/strong&gt; and what can be improved before
&lt;strong&gt;Oneiric&lt;/strong&gt; release. Lot of work has to be done yet, in particular about
accessibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last session of this day, a
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://summit.ubuntu.com/uds-o/meeting/other-o-sabdfl-community-qa/"&gt;Q+A&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;
with &lt;strong&gt;Mark Shuttleworth&lt;/strong&gt;. The session was very interesting! He replied
to all questions coming from the public and from IRC.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Andrea Grandi</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 11 May 2011 18:24:00 +0200</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:www.andreagrandi.it,2011-05-11:/2011/05/11/uds-day-3/</guid><category>Linux, Ubuntu (EN), UDS</category><category>Budapest</category><category>Developer</category><category>Linux</category><category>summit</category><category>Ubuntu</category><category>UDS</category><category>UDS-O</category></item></channel></rss>
