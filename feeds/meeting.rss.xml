announced&lt;/a&gt;
the usual UDS was not going to happen I was a bit shocked and
disappointed: starting from the next UDS (that is going to happen
tomorrow!) the event will be &lt;strong&gt;online only&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;every 3 months&lt;/strong&gt;.
During these days I've been thinking a lot about this move and I will
tell you what are the pros and cons, in my opinion, followed by some
final thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Pros&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having 4 UDS every year, instead of 2, is surely a better thing. I'm a
big fan of Scrum methodology, so I think that &lt;strong&gt;iterating more often is
better&lt;/strong&gt; than iterating less. If there are any mistakes you can correct
them and iterating again before releasing the final product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Potentially &lt;strong&gt;more people can partecipate&lt;/strong&gt; to the event (even the
opposite is true and I will explain why). People won't need to move from
home, travel, pay any expense etc... they just need a computer and a
good Internet connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's &lt;strong&gt;cheaper for everyone&lt;/strong&gt;: I can just imagine how expensive could be
for Canonical to organize a similar event. Booking a big hotel, paying
travel and expenses to near one houndred of community people. People who
didn't get any sponsorization had to pay all the travel expenses to
attend the event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Cons&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Potentially &lt;strong&gt;less people can partecipate&lt;/strong&gt; to the event. Yes, like I
said before even this sentence is true and I will explain why. First of
all, using Google+ there are at least three countries that will be cut
out: &lt;strong&gt;China&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Thailand&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Vietnam&lt;/strong&gt;. Google+ is not available
in those countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you sure that special people will be able to follow the event? For
example &lt;strong&gt;blind people&lt;/strong&gt; won't be able to chat or to ask question in the
chat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Only 10 people&lt;/strong&gt; will be able to talk. In normal UDS sessions more
people could raise the hand and ask a question or interact with the
track leaders. Who will choose the 10 people with audio+video streaming
rights?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will &lt;strong&gt;completly miss the social aspect&lt;/strong&gt; of the UDS. If you think
this was only a secondary part, please go on. I felt more committed to
work and collaborate with people I met in person than with someone I've
never met before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Announcing an event, even if online, just &lt;strong&gt;one week before&lt;/strong&gt; it
happens. Really? Some people had already taken vacation from work,
booked flights etc... not counting many people that can't take 2 days
off from work just with 1 week notice period. It's also almost
impossible that community members have the time to schedule a blueprint
and be able to discuss about a subject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Final thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a &lt;strong&gt;cutting costs&lt;/strong&gt; point of view I really can't say anything.
Organizing UDS was surely very expensive for Canonical and nobody can
blame them if they decided to spend those money in a different way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What really concerns me: is UDS still useful? My opinion is that at
least since latest 2 or 3 UDS the presence of the Community was not so
relevant, because I had &lt;strong&gt;the clear sensation that the most important
decisions were made by Canonical before the UDS&lt;/strong&gt; and then there was
just some details tuning. Another proof of my thoughts is the today
announcement: &lt;strong&gt;despite the fact that I 100% agree with Unity switching
to Qt/QML&lt;/strong&gt; (I already proposed this 2 years ago during Budapest UDS,
but nobody listened to me) &lt;strong&gt;I completly disagree with the way the
decision was made&lt;/strong&gt;: not a single involvement or discussion with the
community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would apreaciate &lt;strong&gt;more openness and honesty&lt;/strong&gt; from Canonical. Do you
want to take all the decisions? That's fine, but at least state it
clearly.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">admin</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 05 Mar 2013 01:09:00 +0100</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:www.andreagrandi.it,2013-03-05:/2013/03/05/uds-happening-online-only-pros-and-cons/</guid><category>Ubuntu (EN), UDS</category><category>Canonical</category><category>community</category><category>Linux</category><category>meeting</category><category>Ubuntu</category><category>UDS</category></item><item><title>Ubuntu Release Sprint: calling for feedback!</title><link>https://www.andreagrandi.it/2012/08/17/ubuntu-release-sprint-calling-for-feedback/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;During the last UDS party, I had an idea to improve Ubuntu development,
but I didn't know if it could be a good idea or a stupid one, so I
talked to &lt;strong&gt;Daniel Holbach&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;David Planella&lt;/strong&gt; about it and they
were happy to hear about it and Daniel told me to talk about
this directly to &lt;strong&gt;Mark&lt;/strong&gt; (and I did it).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's explain the basic idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From an UDS and the next one, it would be useful to have a
development sprint where people can talk about assigned UDS blueprints,
at which point they are on their tasks, if they have any problems and if
they will finish them within the next UDS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course Canonical cannot organize another meeting, it would be
very expensive, so the idea is: why don't we use &lt;strong&gt;Google Hangout&lt;/strong&gt; to
organize the sprint? I has a limit of 10 people, I know, but we could
select (for example) 5 from the community and 5 from Canonical. There
would be parallel meeting and tracks, we would use the same blueprints
used during the last UDS and we would add further notes. The
attendees would be able to listen and watch the stream and make
questions through the available chat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've also created a &lt;strong&gt;wiki&lt;/strong&gt; page with more informations and you can
find it here: &lt;a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuReleaseSprint"&gt;https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuReleaseSprint&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do you think about? I know that Canonical is already
organizing sprints and this could be a way to involve more the Ubuntu
Community. Maybe we should schedule a session &lt;strong&gt;at next UDS&lt;/strong&gt; to talk
about this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope to get some &lt;strong&gt;feedback&lt;/strong&gt; from you.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">admin</dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 17 Aug 2012 12:28:00 +0200</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:www.andreagrandi.it,2012-08-17:/2012/08/17/ubuntu-release-sprint-calling-for-feedback/</guid><category>Ubuntu (EN)</category><category>development</category><category>meeting</category><category>sprint</category><category>Ubuntu</category><category>UDS</category></item><item><title>UX meets Code hackfest in December @ Barcelona: confirmed!</title><link>https://www.andreagrandi.it/2009/11/03/ux-meets-code-hackfest-in-december-barcelona-confirmed/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quim Gil&lt;/strong&gt; just confirmed the &lt;strong&gt;UX hackfest&lt;/strong&gt; in &lt;strong&gt;Barcelona&lt;/strong&gt; for
&lt;strong&gt;4, 5, 6 december&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href="http://talk.maemo.org/showthread.php?t=33719"&gt;http://talk.maemo.org/showthread.php?t=33719&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is UX hackfest?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
It's a three days meeting for Maemo developers, UX experts and people
who want to learn about designing good user interfaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
On 4, 5, 6 december 2009&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Barcelona, Spain. The exact location has still to be confirmed, but it
should be &lt;a href="http://citilab.eu"&gt;http://citilab.eu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How many people invited?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
About 50 people invited (Maemo developers, UX experts, ecc....)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are a Maemo developer and you have good user interface designer
skills, this is the place for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are a Maemo developer and you are not a UX expert, this IS anyway
the place for you: you'll have the possibility to talk with experts and
improve your knowledge about UI design.&lt;/p&gt;

a &lt;strong&gt;Nokia&lt;/strong&gt;, avrò l'occasione fra pochi giorni di partecipare al
&lt;a href="http://wiki.maemo.org/Maemo_Summit_2008"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maemo Summit&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; che si terrà
a &lt;strong&gt;Berlino&lt;/strong&gt;. Si svolgerà nei giorni di &lt;strong&gt;venerdi 19&lt;/strong&gt; e &lt;strong&gt;sabato 20
settembre&lt;/strong&gt; e sarà ospitato nella splendida sede del
&lt;a href="http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-base"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;C-base&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Il Maemo Summit è un meeting degli sviluppatori e appassionati di Maemo,
la piattaforma utilizzata sugli internet tablet della Nokia. Sarà
un'occasione per conoscere di persona tantissima gente con la quale fino
ad ora ho avuto a che fare soltanto tramite la mailing list o il canale
IRC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nei prossimi giorni sperò di riuscire a postare, quasi in tempo reale e
connessione internet permettendo, un report dettagliato di quello che
verrà fatto all'interno del C-base. Non mancheranno ovviamente le
fotografie, che avrò cura di pubblicare su Flickr!&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">admin</dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 17 Sep 2008 01:55:00 +0200</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:www.andreagrandi.it,2008-09-17:/2008/09/17/maemo-summit-sto-arrivando/</guid><category>Maemo (IT)</category><category>berlino</category><category>maemo</category><category>meeting</category><category>nokia</category><category>summit</category></item></channel></rss>
