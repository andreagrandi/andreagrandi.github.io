Jam&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and about &lt;strong&gt;15 people&lt;/strong&gt;
attended the event. We began with an introductive talk by &lt;strong&gt;Paolo
Sammicheli&lt;/strong&gt; about the Italian Ubuntu Community and how it is possible
to contribute to Ubuntu. We divided in two small groups, one translating
from English to Italian (coordinated on IRC by the people of the
community) and another group leaded by &lt;strong&gt;Marco Trevisan&lt;/strong&gt;, learning how
to implement automatic tests in Unity code (in particular he introduced
us &lt;strong&gt;Autopilot&lt;/strong&gt;, more information
here: &lt;a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Unity/QA/Autopilot"&gt;https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Unity/QA/Autopilot&lt;/a&gt; ). Next time I would
like to ask people to register to Launchpad and sign the Code of Conduct
&lt;strong&gt;before&lt;/strong&gt; attending the global jam. We wasted a lot of time with this
task.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of the day me and the other people from Pistoia, took the
other people for a quick tour around the city where we had the
possibility to eat some tasty food. It was a very amazing day and people
who started collaborating for the first time were very happy! I think
this has been a successful day, at least for us. I hope the other LoCo
are having a good Jam as well and I really can't wait for the next
Ubuntu Global Jam.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">admin</dc:creator><pubDate>Sun, 04 Mar 2012 14:24:00 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:www.andreagrandi.it,2012-03-04:/2012/03/04/ubuntu-global-jam-italy-pistoia-a-quick-review/</guid><category>LoCo</category><category>pistoia</category><category>Ubuntu</category><category>UGJ</category></item></channel></rss>
