&lt;strong&gt;24,95\$/year&lt;/strong&gt; and I was looking for something cheaper. Anyway I was
thinking that after all, even if I don't renew my account, I can always
access to all my pictures.... wrong! &lt;strong&gt;If you don't renew your pro
Flickr account you can only access to the low resolution version of your
own pictures.&lt;/strong&gt; That's not acceptable for me, so I decided to download
all my pictures and upload them somewhere else. Here comes the second
disappointment: &lt;strong&gt;there is no automatic way to download all your
pictures&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I simply had no time to write an application by myself, so I started
searching on Google to see if there was something available to do this
simple task. At the beginning I only found abandoned tools (closed
source, the API was expired ecc...), paid tools, Windows only tools
ecc... but finally I found this
post &lt;a href="http://hivelogic.com/articles/backing-up-flickr/"&gt;http://hivelogic.com/articles/backing-up-flickr/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a Python script that automatically downloads all your Flickr
pictures getting the highest resolution available, you can download the
script from here &lt;a href="https://github.com/dan/hivelogic-flickrtouchr"&gt;https://github.com/dan/hivelogic-flickrtouchr&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The usage is very simple&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[sourcecode lang="text"]&lt;br&gt;
mkdir FlickrBackupFolder&lt;br&gt;
python flickrtouchr.py FlickrBackupFolder&lt;br&gt;
[/sourcecode]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A browser's window will be opened and you'll be prompted for
authorization. After that, all you pictures will be downloaded.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've been a Flickr pro user for 4 years, but the pro account costs
