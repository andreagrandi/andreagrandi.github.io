    <p>
      Posted on Sat 21 October 2017 in <a href="https://www.andreagrandi.it/category/howto.html">HowTo</a>

              <a href="https://www.andreagrandi.it/tag/gnupg.html">GnuPG</a>,              <a href="https://www.andreagrandi.it/tag/pgp.html">PGP</a>,              <a href="https://www.andreagrandi.it/tag/security.html">Security</a>,              <a href="https://www.andreagrandi.it/tag/encryption.html">Encryption</a>,              <a href="https://www.andreagrandi.it/tag/keybase.html">Keybase</a>

      <p>Using PGP can be quite hard, even if you have a lot of experience with computers.
By the way encryption is what gives us privacy and permits us to safely transmit information
and for this reason it should be easy to use, for everyone.</p>
<p><a href="https://keybase.io">Keybase</a> really makes encryption easy to use.</p>
<h3>PGP identity</h3>
<p>When Keybase was launched it was mainly a wrapper for PGP commands
to encrypt and decrypt a message for a certain user, but it also introduced a very nice
chain of trust.</p>
<p>In Keybase it's possible to either generate a new PGP key or import an existing one
but the most important thing is being able to verify our own identity using multiple proofs.</p>
<p>Many of us have a personal blog, a Twitter or Facebook accounts, a GitHub account etc...
All these accounts combined together make our online identity.</p>
<p>Every Keybase account can be verified by other online identities. In Keybase
you don't just say "I'm Andrea Grandi, this is my PGP key...". In Keybase you
can link your existing online accounts to your Keybase account and show additional
proofs of your identity.</p>
<p>Unless an attacker controls all your social accounts, they cannot impersonate and verify
themselves as if they were you.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.andreagrandi.it/images/2017/10/keybase_identity.png"><img alt="keybase identity" src="https://www.andreagrandi.it/images/2017/10/keybase_identity.png" width="100%"></a></p>
<p>Once you are on Keybase, other users can look for you even using your GitHub or Twitter username
without having to know your email address or Keybase username. This concept can be
very useful in some situations, we will see it later.</p>
<h3>Encrypted Filesystem</h3>
<p>One of the first features launched by Keybase was their encrypted filesystem.
There is a virtual folder located at <strong>/keybase</strong> (on OSX/Linux or k:\keybase on Windows)
where you will find at least three other folders: <strong>public</strong>, <strong>private</strong>, <strong>team</strong>.</p>
<h4>Public folders</h4>
<p>Anything you place inside the /public folder can be accessed by any Keybase user and it's
automatically signed. Every user public folder/file can be accessed using their Keybase username,
like for example <strong>/keybase/public/andreagrandi/hello.txt</strong> but you can also use any other identity like
<strong>/keybase/public/andreagrandi@github/hello.txt</strong> or <strong>/keybase/public/andreagrandi@twitter/hello.txt</strong></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This is very useful if you only know a person on Twitter (or GitHub etc...) and you want to
share a file with them (or send a message, as we will see later) but you don't follow each other
and you can't reach them privately.</p>
<p>This is a public folder example of one of the Keybase developers:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.andreagrandi.it/images/2017/10/keybase_chris_folder.png"><img alt="keybase chris folder" src="https://www.andreagrandi.it/images/2017/10/keybase_chris_folder.png" width="60%"></a></p>
<p>You can put whatever you want in these folders: your public PGP key, your official avatar,
your Signal fingerprint etc... the other users will access these files with the assurance they
haven't been changed by anyone else in the middle.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> please keep in mind that Keybase doesn't work like Dropbox or similar. Files are not
synced between your devices and Keybase servers. Files are streamed on demand, so <strong>you won't be able to access these files without a working Internet connection</strong>.</p>
<h4>Private folders</h4>
<p>Hey but... where is the encryption here?! Whatever you put inside your <strong>private</strong>
folder can only be read by you and only you. <strong>Not even Keybase employees can access the content of your files</strong>,
because they are encrypted before leaving your devices and decrypted on demand
when you want to access them.</p>
<p>Do you want to share files with <strong>anotheruser</strong>? No problem. Just create a file inside <strong>/keybase/private/andreagrandi,anotheruser</strong>
(the folder <strong>andreagrandi,anotheruser</strong> will implicitely exist already) and that file will only be readable by you and <strong>anotheruser</strong>.</p>
<h4>Security and other information</h4>
<p>Keybase employes only have access to: 1) your top level folder names (like: "andreagrandi,anotheruser"),
2) when and for how long you are reading/writing, 3) how much space you are using.</p>
<p>They won't be able to access the content of your files and not even the files or folders names.</p>
<p>Every user initially had 10GB quota available, but a few hints (including one of their <a href="https://www.andreagrandi.it/images/2017/10/teams-splash-announcement.png">recent screenshots</a>)
say that now <strong>users have 250GB available</strong> to store their files.</p>
<p>You can find more technical information about Keybase encrypted folders in this article: <a href="https://keybase.io/docs/kbfs">https://keybase.io/docs/kbfs</a></p>
<h3>Encrypted Chat</h3>
<p>A few months ago Keybase introduced the encrypted chat. Messages between users
are <strong>end to end encrypted</strong> and cannot be read by anyone else, not even having access to Keybase
servers.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.andreagrandi.it/images/2017/10/keybase_chat.png"><img alt="kybase chat" src="https://www.andreagrandi.it/images/2017/10/keybase_chat.png" width="100%"></a></p>
<h4>A better address book</h4>
<p>When we use services like WhatsApp or Signal, we are forced to share our telephone number if we want
the other person to be able to contact us.</p>
<p>On Keybase I don't need to share my telephone number. Anyone can reach me using one of my online
identities: <strong>andreagrandi@twitter</strong>, <strong>andreagrandi@github</strong> etc...</p>
<p>You can even send a message to a person who is <strong>not on Keybase yet</strong>: if you send a message to
randomuser@twitter, when randomuser joins Keybase and verify their Twitter account, the message
will be encrypted for them and will be safely delivered.</p>
<h4>Security</h4>
<p>Keybase doesn't use PGP to encrypt chat or files. Transmitting the key across all devices
wouldn't be safe so each message is encrypted using the public key of every device connected
to the account.</p>
<h4>Command line</h4>
<p>Keybase works from the command line too. There is no need to use the graphic
client to send a message to another user, you can do something like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>keybase chat send andreagrandi <span class="s2">&quot;Hello mate!&quot;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>You can integrate messages in any script and it's even available a JSON API:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>keybase chat <span class="nb">help</span> api
</pre></div>


<p>For more details you can have a look a this blog post on their website: <a href="https://keybase.io/blog/keybase-chat">https://keybase.io/blog/keybase-chat</a></p>
<h3>Teams</h3>
<p>Keybase has recently introduced Teams feature. The Chat becomes more similar to Slack, but with the difference that
only team members can read the content of messages and files: the server only knows about team names and users, nobody else can
access the content.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.andreagrandi.it/images/2017/10/teams-splash-announcement.png"><img alt="teams announcement" src="https://www.andreagrandi.it/images/2017/10/teams-splash-announcement.png" width="100%"></a></p>
<p>It's important to mention that in Keybase there aren't private channels like there are in Slack: if a team wants to have
channels accessible only from a restricted group of users, the admin needs to create a sub team. For example if you have a
team called <strong>keybaselovers</strong> you can create a sub team for admins only called <strong>keybaselovers.admins</strong></p>
<p>Teams have a dedicated encrypter folder that you will find under <strong>/keybase/team/keybaselovers</strong></p>
<p>At the moment the features available from the UI are quite limited and are only available from the command line. In the next
weeks these features will be available from the UI too. In the mean time you can have a look at the commandline help:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>keybase team --help <span class="c1"># for admin&#39;ing teams</span>
keybase chat --help <span class="c1"># for admin&#39;ing chat channels</span>
</pre></div>


<h4>Create a Team</h4>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>keybase team create keybaselovers
</pre></div>


<h4>Add a user to a Team</h4>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>keybase team add-member keybaselovers --user<span class="o">=</span>alice --role<span class="o">=</span>writer
</pre></div>


<p>For more information you can have a look at the official announcement page: <a href="https://keybase.io/blog/introducing-keybase-teams">https://keybase.io/blog/introducing-keybase-teams</a></p>
<h3>Git</h3>
<p>Sometimes we have the need to store private information in a safe way and we want to be sure that nobody else is
able to access these information.</p>
<p>Latest feature that has been added to Keybase is <strong>encrypted Git repositories</strong>. They are like normal GitHub
repositories, but their content is stored in a safer way.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.andreagrandi.it/images/2017/10/keybase_git.png"><img alt="keybase git" src="https://www.andreagrandi.it/images/2017/10/keybase_git.png" width="100%"></a></p>
<h4>Privacy and Security</h4>
<p>What is the <strong>difference</strong> with GitHub private repositories? In GitHub a private repository is used to store information that
only our account can access, but the files are accessible in plain text by GitHub employees. With encrypted Git repositories
instead, the <strong>information are encrypted before they leave our device</strong> and they are stored encrypted. Nobody, without having our
private key can read them, not even Keybase employees.</p>
<h4>Teams and Quota</h4>
<p>Encrypted Git repositories are of course available for teams too. Creating a team repository, it will be available to
all the members of the team.</p>
<p>Both teams and single users have <strong>100GB of space</strong> available (which is separate from Folders quota).</p>
<h4>Usage</h4>
<p>If I create my personal repository called <strong>documents</strong> all I have to do to clone it and use it is:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git clone keybase://private/andreagrandi/documents
</pre></div>


<p>and I can use it as a normal git repository. Every time I commit and push something, the content will be <strong>signed and encrypted</strong>
and only available to the repository owner (which is me) or to the whole team if it's a team repository.</p>
<p>For more information, please have a look at the official announcement here: <a href="https://keybase.io/blog/encrypted-git-for-everyone">https://keybase.io/blog/encrypted-git-for-everyone</a></p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Keybase is still in continuous development but it already offers a few interesting features which can help people
in their every day life. I strongly advise anyone to <a href="https://keybase.io"><strong>get an account</strong></a>, play with the available features and <strong>report any bug</strong>
so the developers will be able to fix them and build an even better product. I can't wait to see the features they will
announce in the next months!</p>

    </p>
  </header>
  <div>
      <p>I've recently bought a <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Yubico-Y-158-YubiKey-4-Black/dp/B018Y1Q71M/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1507054059&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=yubico+4&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=andreagrandi-21&amp;linkId=6da97357c6fe86ca94df918c172f6605">YubiKey 4</a> and 
decided to use it for GnuPG too, other than using it as hardware 2FA.</p>
<p>I've also decided to make my GnuPG configuration much more safe, generating the <strong>master key</strong>
on an <strong>offline</strong> computer (in my case a simple RaspberryPi not connected to Internet) and <strong>generating a subkey</strong>
that will be moved to my <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Yubico-Y-158-YubiKey-4-Black/dp/B018Y1Q71M/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1507054059&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=yubico+4&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=andreagrandi-21&amp;linkId=6da97357c6fe86ca94df918c172f6605">YubiKey</a>.</p>
<h4>Disclaimer</h4>
<p>Always think about what your <strong>threat model</strong> is before deciding something is 100% safe for you.
I'm not claiming this setup/configuration is bullet proof. If you want to protect your GnuPG key from most of the hackers,
keyloggers and if you want to use it on different computers without ever compromising your secret key, this setup
can be what you are looking for. If you think you may be victim of a targeted state sponsored attack, I'm not sure this
setup could be enough.</p>
<h4>Why keeping offline the master key?</h4>
<p>If you only use your master key on a computer that never connects to Internet (I reckon you will want to update/patch it
from time to time, that's why we are going to keep the master key on an external USB key) you are at least safe from remote attacks.</p>
<h4>Why using subkeys?</h4>
<p>Your GnuPG master key is also your "identity" among every PGP user. If you loose your master key or if your key is compromised
you need to rebuild your identity and reputation from scratch. Instead, if a subkey is compromised, you can revoke the subkey (using your
master key) and generate a new subkey.</p>
<h4>How a YubiKey makes things safer?</h4>
<p>If you always use your subkey from a <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Yubico-Y-158-YubiKey-4-Black/dp/B018Y1Q71M/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1507054059&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=yubico+4&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=andreagrandi-21&amp;linkId=6da97357c6fe86ca94df918c172f6605">YubiKey</a>, it's very unlikely that your
private key can be stolen: it's impossible to read it from the <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Yubico-Y-158-YubiKey-4-Black/dp/B018Y1Q71M/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1507054059&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=yubico+4&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=andreagrandi-21&amp;linkId=6da97357c6fe86ca94df918c172f6605">YubiKey</a> and if you loose your YubiKey
or if it's physically stolen, the attacker will still need your passphrase and your YubiKey PIN.</p>
<h3>Requirements</h3>
<ul>
<li>1 <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Yubico-Y-158-YubiKey-4-Black/dp/B018Y1Q71M/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1507054059&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=yubico+4&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=andreagrandi-21&amp;linkId=6da97357c6fe86ca94df918c172f6605">YubiKey 4</a></li>
<li>2 USB keys (in theory you only need one, but I strongly suggest you have another one as backup)</li>
<li>1 offline computer (a simple RaspberryPi with no Internet connection will be fine)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Initial setup</h3>
<p>From now on, I will assume that you have prepared a computer for offline use (in my case I'm using a RaspberryPi 2 with
Raspbian) and you will type the next commands there and only there.</p>
<p>Plug one of the <strong>USB key</strong> (you can format it with VFAT for simplicity) in the offline computer and wait for the system to mount it.
At this point it should be mounted in a path like this: <strong>/media/AABB-BAAC</strong></p>
<p>Now set the GnuPG working directory and create it:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>user@debian:~$ export GNUPGHOME=/media/AABB-BAAC/gnupghome
user@debian:~$ mkdir $GNUPGHOME
</pre></div>


<h4>Second disclaimer</h4>
<p>If you think your threat model doesn't include someone can hack your computer from remote,
you can ignore my advice and type these commands on your main laptop (at your own risk).</p>
<h4>Note</h4>
<p>For my own convenience, to write this tutorial I reproduced all these steps on my MacBook because it was easier to copy/paste
commands and outputs but I've tested it with the exact setup I'm describing, and it
should be compatible with OSX and Linux.
When you see something has been masked it's just to hide (from spam) things like my email or to protect the serial number
of my <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Yubico-Y-158-YubiKey-4-Black/dp/B018Y1Q71M/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1507054059&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=yubico+4&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=andreagrandi-21&amp;linkId=6da97357c6fe86ca94df918c172f6605">YubiKey</a>. Last but not least, the output shown here could not match exactly the one you get on your own PC and this also
depends on the GnuPG version you are using.</p>
<h3>Generating the master key</h3>
<p>The master key must be generated using the advanced mode, because by default when a new master key is generated, also a new subkey
is created with all the capabilities (Authentication + Signing + Encryption), while we want something different.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> PGP keys up to <strong>4096 bits</strong> are only supported in <strong>YubiKey 4</strong> models. If you have a <strong>YubiKey NEO</strong> you must use
a <strong>2048 bits</strong> key because it's the maximum size supported. Here you will create a PGP key with <strong>only
the Authentication capability</strong>. If your GnuPG version doesn't allow this, choose "sign only", just don't
create the encryption capability at this time.</p>

GnuPG needs to construct a user ID to identify your key.

Real name: Andrea Grandi
Email address: user@email.com
Comment:
You selected this USER-ID:
    &quot;Andrea Grandi &lt;user@email.com&gt;&quot;

Change (N)ame, (C)omment, (E)mail or (O)kay/(Q)uit? o
You need a Passphrase to protect your secret key.

We need to generate a lot of random bytes. It is a good idea to perform
some other action (type on the keyboard, move the mouse, utilize the
disks) during the prime generation; this gives the random number
generator a better chance to gain enough entropy.

<p><strong>Note:</strong> please remember to save your passphrase in a safe place. Choose something you
can remember because you will need it every time you need to sign, encrypt or decrypt something.</p>
<h3>Creating a revocation certificate</h3>
<p>It's very important to create a revocation certificate to be used if and when 
in the future you want to change your master key and revoke the existing one:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>user@debian:~$ gpg --gen-revoke 2240402E &gt; 2240402E-revocation-certificate.asc

sec  4096R/2240402E 2017-09-25 Andrea Grandi &lt;user@email.com&gt;

Create a revocation certificate for this key? (y/N) y
Please select the reason for the revocation:
0 = No reason specified
1 = Key has been compromised
2 = Key is superseded
3 = Key is no longer used
Q = Cancel
(Probably you want to select 1 here)
Your decision? 3
Enter an optional description; end it with an empty line:
&gt;
Reason for revocation: Key is no longer used
(No description given)
Is this okay? (y/N) y

You need a passphrase to unlock the secret key for
user: &quot;Andrea Grandi &lt;user@email.com&gt;&quot;
4096-bit RSA key, ID 2240402E, created 2017-09-25

ASCII armored output forced.
Revocation certificate created.

Please move it to a medium which you can hide away; if Mallory gets
access to this certificate he can use it to make your key unusable.
It is smart to print this certificate and store it away, just in case
your media become unreadable.  But have some caution:  The print system of
your machine might store the data and make it available to others!
</pre></div>


<h3>Creating Encryption subkey</h3>
<p>To create a subkey we need to edit the existing key (please note that <strong>2240402E</strong>
is the last 8 chars from the fingerprint of the previously generated master key)
and specify we want to create an Encryption only key.</p>

<h3>Export a backup of the secret keys</h3>
<p>It's very important to export a backup of the secret keys at this point.
Writing the secret subkey to the <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Yubico-Y-158-YubiKey-4-Black/dp/B018Y1Q71M/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1507054059&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=yubico+4&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=andreagrandi-21&amp;linkId=6da97357c6fe86ca94df918c172f6605">YubiKey</a> is a destructive process: keys are moved

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>user@debian:~$ gpg --export-secret-key 2240402E &gt; 2240402E-secret.pgp
</pre></div>


<p><strong>Note:</strong> this backup includes both the secret master key and the secret subkey.
Please remember to <strong>save a backup of this key</strong> on a couple of separate USB keys: you will need
this keys to generate future subkeys and/or to revoke the existing ones.</p>
<h3>Programming the YubiKey with all GnuPG keys</h3>
<p>We have previously created the <strong>master key</strong> and the <strong>encryption subkey</strong>. Now we will
create the <strong>authentication</strong> and <strong>signing</strong> keys directly on the <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Yubico-Y-158-YubiKey-4-Black/dp/B018Y1Q71M/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1507054059&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=yubico+4&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=andreagrandi-21&amp;linkId=6da97357c6fe86ca94df918c172f6605">YubiKey</a> (we don't
need to have a copy of these keys) and we will move the secret encryption key
to the <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Yubico-Y-158-YubiKey-4-Black/dp/B018Y1Q71M/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1507054059&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=yubico+4&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=andreagrandi-21&amp;linkId=6da97357c6fe86ca94df918c172f6605">YubiKey</a>.</p>

<h4>Check public keys</h4>
<p>Just to verify everything has been created correctly, we check the public keys.
We should see one <strong>pub</strong> key and three <strong>sub</strong>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>user@debian:~$ gpg -k

--------------------------------

</pre></div>


<h4>Check private keys</h4>
<p>When we check the private keys we should see that one key is still local, marked as <strong>sec</strong> (it's
the private key of the master key), while three other keys are marked as <strong>ssb&gt;</strong>
which means they have been moved to the <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Yubico-Y-158-YubiKey-4-Black/dp/B018Y1Q71M/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1507054059&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=yubico+4&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=andreagrandi-21&amp;linkId=6da97357c6fe86ca94df918c172f6605">YubiKey</a>:</p>

<h4>Import back secret keys from backup (only for multiple YubiKeys)</h4>
<p>As previously said, when we write the encryption subkey to the <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Yubico-Y-158-YubiKey-4-Black/dp/B018Y1Q71M/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1507054059&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=yubico+4&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=andreagrandi-21&amp;linkId=6da97357c6fe86ca94df918c172f6605">YubiKey</a>, the key
is <strong>moved</strong> and not just copied, so we need to import back the secret key into
the keyring. It's important to have a backup of the subkey too, not because we need it
in case the key is compromised etc... but because we need it in case we want to write
multiple YubiKeys with the same encryption key, so that we have a backup key to use.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>user@debian:~$ gpg --import &lt; 2240402E-secret.pgp

<h4>Completely remove secret keys from laptop</h4>
<p>Once you have programmed the <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Yubico-Y-158-YubiKey-4-Black/dp/B018Y1Q71M/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1507054059&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=yubico+4&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=andreagrandi-21&amp;linkId=6da97357c6fe86ca94df918c172f6605">YubiKey</a> and you are sure the secret keys are
backed up on a couple of USB keys, you are ready to remove the secret keys from your laptop.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> you don't need to remove anything if you have conducted the whole setup
on a spare offline PC (or on a RaspberryPi) because that's not your every day computer.</p>

<h3>Exporting the public PGP key</h3>
<p>As you know, PGP keys are composed by a secret part and a public one. The public one
must be distributed publicly and it's the one people will use to encrypt messages directed
to you.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>user@debian:~$ gpg --armor --export 2240402E &gt; 2240402E.asc

can be found here <a href="https://www.andreagrandi.it/2240402E.asc">https://www.andreagrandi.it/2240402E.asc</a>)</p>
<h3>Change YubiKey PINs and complete configuration</h3>

that is required every time we need to use the key to sign/decrypt something (in addition
to our passphrase) and there is an <strong>admin PIN</strong> that is required every time we change
certain settings on the <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Yubico-Y-158-YubiKey-4-Black/dp/B018Y1Q71M/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1507054059&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=yubico+4&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=andreagrandi-21&amp;linkId=6da97357c6fe86ca94df918c172f6605">YubiKey</a>.</p>
<p>The default values are:</p>
<ul>
<li>user PIN: 123456</li>
<li>admin PIN: 12345678</li>
</ul>
<p>I strongly recommend you to change them following this example:</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> when you want to use your <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Yubico-Y-158-YubiKey-4-Black/dp/B018Y1Q71M/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1507054059&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=yubico+4&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=andreagrandi-21&amp;linkId=6da97357c6fe86ca94df918c172f6605">YubiKey</a> on any computer (for example your work laptop)
you need to at least import your public PGP key into the keyring. If the key is not
read automatically, you may need to give it a refresh using this command:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>user@debian:~$ gpg --card-status
</pre></div>


<h4>Careful with PINs</h4>
<p>Please remember that you can only digit a wrong user PIN for a maximum of three times.
After three time you will need to edit the <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Yubico-Y-158-YubiKey-4-Black/dp/B018Y1Q71M/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1507054059&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=yubico+4&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=andreagrandi-21&amp;linkId=6da97357c6fe86ca94df918c172f6605">YubiKey</a> (with <strong>gpg --card-edit</strong>) become admin
and use the <strong>unblock PIN</strong> option. If you digit the wrong admin PIN for three time, you will have
to follow a quite complicated procedure (explained at this address: <a href="https://developers.yubico.com/ykneo-openpgp/ResetApplet.html">https://developers.yubico.com/ykneo-openpgp/ResetApplet.html</a>)
and your <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Yubico-Y-158-YubiKey-4-Black/dp/B018Y1Q71M/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1507054059&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=yubico+4&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=andreagrandi-21&amp;linkId=6da97357c6fe86ca94df918c172f6605">YubiKey</a> will be reset with factory settings, deleting your PGP keys from it.</p>

<p>I'm trying a little experiment with the Amazon Association program. Basically, if you click

I've never tried this before and I've no idea if it works or not. I'm writing this here just for the
sake of transparency.</p>

      <p>When we need to create an EC2 resource on AWS using Terraform, we need to specify the AMI id to get the correct image.
The id is not easy to memorise and it changes depending on the zone we are working one. On every new release the id changes again.
So, how can we be sure to get the correct ID for our region, of the latest image available for a given Linux distribution?</p>
<h3>Getting latest Ubuntu AMI id</h3>
<p>In this example I will show how to get the ID for the latest version of Ubuntu 16.04 server, for the London region and create an EC2 instance using that ID.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="kr">variable</span> <span class="nv">&quot;aws_region&quot;</span> <span class="p">{</span><span class="err"> default = &quot;eu-west-2&quot; } # London</span>

</pre></div>


<p>After we have initialised our script using <strong>terraform init</strong> if we run it, we will get the AMI id and the instance will be created:</p>

    </p>
  </header>
  <div>
      <p>In the <a href="https://www.andreagrandi.it/2017/03/12/creating-a-production-ready-api-with-python-and-django-rest-framework-part-3/">previous
part</a>
of the tutorial we implemented <strong>details</strong> management, <strong>relations</strong>
between models, <strong>nested APIs</strong> and a different level of permissions.
Our API is basically complete but it is working properly? Is the source
code free of bugs? Would you feel confident to refactor the code without
breaking something? The answer to all our question is probably no. <strong>I
can't be sure if the code behaves properly nor I would feel confident
refactoring anything without having some tests coverage</strong>.</p>
<p>As I mentioned previously, we should have written tests since the
beginning, but I really didn't want to mix too many concepts together
and I wanted to let the user concentrate on the Rest Framework instead.</p>
<h3>Test structure and configuration</h3>
<p>Before beginning the fourth part of this tutorial, make sure you have
grabbed the latest source code
from <a href="https://github.com/andreagrandi/drf-tutorial">https://github.com/andreagrandi/drf-tutorial</a> and you have checked
out the previous git tag:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git checkout tutorial-1.14
</pre></div>


<p>Django has an integrated test runner but my personal choice is to use
<a href="https://doc.pytest.org/en/latest/"><strong>pytest</strong></a>, so as first thing let's
install the needed libraries:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>pip install pytest pytest-django
</pre></div>


<p>As long as we respect a minimum of conventions (test files must start
with <strong>test_</strong> prefix), tests can be placed anywhere in the code. My
advice is to put them all together in a separate folder and divide them
according to app names. In our case we are going to create a folder
named "<strong>tests</strong>" at the same level of <strong>manage.py</strong> file. Inside this
folder we need to create a <strong>__init__.py</strong> file and another folder
called <strong>catalog</strong> with an additional <strong>__init__.py</strong> inside. Now,
still at the same level of <strong>manage.py</strong> create a file called
<strong>pytest.ini</strong> with this content:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">pytest</span><span class="p">]</span>
<span class="n">DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">drftutorial</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">settings</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Are you feeling confused? No problem. You can checkout the source code
containing these changes.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git checkout tutorial-1.15
</pre></div>


<p>You can check if you have done everything correctly going inside the
drftutorial folder (the one containing <strong>manage.py</strong>) and launching
<strong>pytest</strong>. If you see something like this, you did your changes
correctly:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="o">(</span>drf-tutorial<span class="o">)</span> ➜  drftutorial git:<span class="o">(</span>master<span class="o">)</span> <span class="nv">pytest</span>

</pre></div>


<h3>Writing the first test</h3>
<p>To begin with, I will show you how to write a simple test that will
verify if the API can return the products list. If you remember we
implemented this API in the first part of the tutorial. First of all
create a file called <strong>test_views.py</strong> under the folder
<strong>drftutorial/tests/catalog/</strong> and add this code:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">pytest</span>
<span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">django.urls</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">reverse</span>
<span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">rest_framework</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">status</span>
<span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">rest_framework.test</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">APITestCase</span>


<span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">TestProductList</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">APITestCase</span><span class="p">):</span>
    <span class="nd">@pytest</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">mark</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">django_db</span>
    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">test_can_get_product_list</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">):</span>
        <span class="n">url</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">reverse</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;product-list&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
        <span class="n">response</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">client</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">get</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">url</span><span class="p">)</span>
        <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">assertEqual</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">response</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">status_code</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">status</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">HTTP_200_OK</span><span class="p">)</span>
        <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">assertEqual</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">len</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">response</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">json</span><span class="p">()),</span> <span class="mi">8</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>before being able to run this test we need to change a little thing in
the <strong>catalog/urls.py</strong> file, something we should have done since the
beginning. Please change the first url in this way, adding the <strong>name</strong>
parameter:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">urlpatterns</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span>
    <span class="n">url</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="sa">r</span><span class="s1">&#39;^products/$&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">views</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">ProductList</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">as_view</span><span class="p">(),</span> <span class="n">name</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s1">&#39;product-list&#39;</span><span class="p">),</span>

<p>at this point we are able to run our test suite again and verify the
test is passing:</p>

<h3>Explaining the test code</h3>
<p>When we implement a test, the first thing to do is to create a
<strong>test_*</strong> file and import the minimum necessary to write a test class
and method. Each test class must inherit from <strong>APITestCase</strong> and have a
name that start with <strong>Test</strong>, like <strong>TestProductList</strong>. Since we use
<a href="https://doc.pytest.org/en/latest/">pytest</a>, we need to mark our method
with <strong>@pytest.mark.django_db decorator</strong>, to tell the test suite our
code will explicitly access the database. We are going to use the <strong>client</strong> object
that is integrated in APITestCase to perform the request. Before doing that we
first get the local <strong>url</strong> using Django's <strong>reverse</strong> function. At this point
we do the call using the client:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">response</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">client</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">get</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">url</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>and then we assert a couple of things that we expect to be true:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">assertEqual</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">response</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">status_code</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">status</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">HTTP_200_OK</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">assertEqual</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">len</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">response</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">json</span><span class="p">()),</span> <span class="mi">8</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>We check that our API returns the <strong>200</strong> status code and that in the returned
JSON there are 8 elements.</p>
<p>It's normally a good practice to create test data inside the tests, but in our case
we previously created a data migration that creates test data. Migrations are
run every time we run tests so when we call our API, the data will be already there.</p>
<h3>Wrapping up</h3>
<p>I've written a <a href="https://github.com/andreagrandi/drf-tutorial/blob/master/drftutorial/tests/catalog/test_views.py">few tests</a> 
for all the views we have implemented until now and they are available
if you checkout this version of the code:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>git checkout tutorial-1.17
</pre></div>


<p>I've only tested the views but it would be nice to test even the permission class, for example.
Please remember to write your tests first, if possible: implementing the code will be much more natural
once the tests are already in place.</p>
