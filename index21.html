</footer><!-- /.post-info -->                <h2>Introduction</h2>
<p><img alt="" src="http://www.andreagrandi.it/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/fon-300x294.jpg" title="fon">{.alignright
.size-medium .wp-image-336 width="168" height="164"}As many of you
already know, <strong>Fon</strong> is a spanish company that some years ago had the
interesting idea of creating a <strong>wifi community</strong> to share the Internet
connection. The idea is quite simple: each "fonero" buy a Fonera (the
router sold by Fon), register it on the Fon system and get a
username/password. If the fonero travels around the world he's able to
connect to wifi signal of other foneras and browse the web for free.</p>
<p>When I bought my first fonera few years ago, I was one of the first
people in my city. I bought it because I was really beliving in this
project. During these years Fon produced new models of fonera and I
bought each of them (the WRT54 router, Fonera, Fonera+, Fonera 2.0g,
Fonera 2.0n ecc....). Since first year, the Fon community has grown a
lot and now there are a lot of foneros around the world.</p>
<h2>Actual situation</h2>
<p>Few months ago Fon launched a very interesting product: <strong>Fonera 2.0g</strong>.
Thats's not only a router. Fonera 2 is capable of managing torrents,
rapidshare downloads, uploading photo on Facebook and Flickr, and much
more. Whats's wrong with this product? It's <strong>very unstable</strong>! There are
a lot of users that bought this router when it was anounced and they're
still waiting for a lot of bugs to be fixed by Fon developers team
(composed by only ONE person!). Why users had to wait so long?</p>
<p>Simple! They were working to Fonera 2.0n! Wow! Faster router, more RAM,
4 ethernet port, wonderful! But... another very unstable router! And
with unstable I mean: it <strong>disconnects/reboots often</strong>, connection is
unstable, applications don't work ecc.... I'm talking about a 79€
router, not about something that users had as preview product. Me and
other users were still waiting for an uograde when... Fon <a href="http://english.martinvarsavsky.net/general/fon-to-unveil-new-fonera-at-mobile-world-congress.html">announced a
new
product</a>!
Yes, another one!</p>
<p>Fon priority is not to fix a product that thousand of users have already
bought. Fon priority is to produce and sell a new product!</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>It could be only my opinion, but I don't trust you anymore Fon! I'm
really disappointed about your behaviour you had with your customers.
I've already spent (wasted) a lot of money with your not-working
products and I'm not going to buy your products anymore! I'm tired of
being illuded by your promises: how long are you going to play tricks on
users?</p>

</footer><!-- /.post-info -->                <p>Being one of the developers who received the discount to buy a N900,
during these days I contacted the DDP customer care to have more
informations and details. I'll publish here both my original question
and the official reply.</p>
<p><strong>1) The price of N900 is 250€ and I've read of people who paid it this
price. Anyway here you say that the VAT is not included:<br>
<a href="https://pro.forum.nokia.com/site/global/tech_resources/discounted_devices/l_ddp.jsp">https://pro.forum.nokia.com/site/global/tech_resources/discounted_devices/l_ddp.jsp</a><br>
so it should costs 300€ not 250€, right?</strong></p>
<p>The VAT applies only for Finnish developers, for the others the price is
the price they see in the eStore, no VAT is added to that.</p>
<p><em>So, all non-finnish european people, will pay <strong>250€</strong> for the N900.</em></p>
<p><strong>2) How much time can I wait before ordering it? In this moment I'm in
Valencia (Spain) and I won't come back to Italy before Christmas. I'd
like the order to be shipped to my home in Italy (I registered as
italian user and I want italian keyboard layout), but I'd like to wait
to order it, because since there's no warranty and I need to tell you
about any problem within a week, if I order it now I will be able to
check it only at the end of december when I'll come back to Italy.</strong></p>
<p>I guess this should not be a problem.</p>
<p><em>This part is not confirmed yet, since Quim told us to hurry up to buy
it.</em></p>
<p><strong>3) How many devices can I buy at that price? Here you say I can
buy two:<br>
<a href="https://pro.forum.nokia.com/site/global/tech_resources/discounted_devices/l_ddp.jsp">https://pro.forum.nokia.com/site/global/tech_resources/discounted_devices/l_ddp.jsp</a><br>
but here you say I can buy one:
<a href="https://pro.forum.nokia.com/showProduct.do?product_id=5096">https://pro.forum.nokia.com/showProduct.do?product_id=5096</a></p>
<p>I don't want two devices, but another friend of mine, who help me in a
project for the Maemo Community, would like to be able to buy one for
the same price (he wasn't able to get the discount because his karma is
still low).</strong></p>
<p>As far as I know, you can only purchase 1x device per person, regarding
MAEMO N900.</p>
<p><strong>4) Where can we find the new firmware? In the FAQ you say: DDP does
not flash devices. It's ok, I can do it, but there's no public firmware
for N900 at the moment.</strong></p>
<p>To update N900, can possibly be using NSU. Nokia software updater.</p>
<p><strong>5) Is it possible to have a device with localized keyboard (for
example italian one) ?</strong></p>
<p>All N900 will have EURO variant, Italian language is one option.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> even these replies come from the official customer care, I
don't assume any responsability if they shouldn't be all exact. If you
have any doubt, please contact them directly at

.size-full .wp-image-320 width="131" height="183"}During next <a href="http://wiki.maemo.org/Maemo_Summit_2009"><strong>Maemo
Summit</strong></a> we will have at least
2 hours (one on saturday and another one on sunday) of lightning talks,
about 20 talks where people will try to explain or present something in
just <strong>5 minutes</strong>.</p>
<p>Last year, during Maemo Summit 2008, I did a lightning talk too and I
must admit: even if I knew a lot about the subject of my talk and even
if I had already done many other talks, I think it wasn't so good as I
expected.</p>
<p>This year I've been selected again (more details will follow) to give a
5 minutes talk and with this great news the kind <a href="http://maemo.org/profile/view/dneary"><strong>Dave
Neary</strong></a> also suggested me a
<a href="http://www.perl.com/pub/a/2004/07/30/lightningtalk.html">link</a> with an
article about some best practices when giving lightning talks. I'll try
to resume the most important points, hoping this will be useful for
people who is going to give a short presentation at Summit.</p>
<p><strong>Go straight to the point:</strong> five minutes finish sooner than you can
expect. You have to talk about the main topic of your talk within the
two first minutes, else you risk to talk too much about the rest and you
couldn't have the time for the most important thing.</p>
<p><strong>Leave details away:</strong> people will never remember too many details
explained in so little time. It's better to leave them away and put them
in a more detailed blog post that you can link within your slides.</p>
<p><strong>Slides:</strong> for a five minute talk you can avoid preparing slides, but
if this can help you to concentrate on points you have to talk about,
please prepare them. Two or three slides can be useful to introduce
yourself, to write any reference of what you're talking about many other
things. Another important thing, make sure your slides are ready before
starting your presentation: people don't want to wait 20-30 seconds it
takes to start Open Office or any other similar application.</p>
<p><strong>Consider any eventuality:</strong> the presentation file could be damaged (be
sure to have a copy of it, better in PDF format), your laptop could have
no more battery (make sure you've a copy of your slides in a USB key),
aliens could take you away, ecc... (ok, this last eventuality is
remote).</p>
<p><strong>Concluding your talk:</strong> don't worry if you finish one or two minutes
before, people won't bother about it. It's better to finish one minute
before than 30 seconds later. If you want to leave an URL where people
can find more details, how to contact you, put it in every slide so
people will be able to take note of it from the first minute.</p>
<p>I hope to have resumed the most important points of the <a href="http://www.perl.com/pub/a/2004/07/30/lightningtalk.html">original
article</a>. If
you think there are any other important things to say, please leave me a
comment and I'll add them. I really hope you will enjoy Maemo Summit and
its lightning talks!</p>
