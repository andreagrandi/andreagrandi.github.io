<p><img alt="" src="http://www.andreagrandi.it/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/fon-300x294.jpg" title="fon">{.alignright
.size-medium .wp-image-336 width="168" height="164"}As many of you
already know, <strong>Fon</strong> is a spanish company that some years ago had the
interesting idea of creating a <strong>wifi community</strong> to share the Internet
connection. The idea is quite simple: each "fonero" buy a Fonera (the
router sold by Fon), register it on the Fon system and get a
username/password. If the fonero travels around the world he's able to
connect to wifi signal of other foneras and browse the web for free.</p>
<p>When I bought my first fonera few years ago, I was one of the first
people in my city. I bought it because I was really beliving in this
project. During these years Fon produced new models of fonera and I
bought each of them (the WRT54 router, Fonera, Fonera+, Fonera 2.0g,
Fonera 2.0n ecc....). Since first year, the Fon community has grown a
lot and now there are a lot of foneros around the world.</p>
<h2>Actual situation</h2>
<p>Few months ago Fon launched a very interesting product: <strong>Fonera 2.0g</strong>.
Thats's not only a router. Fonera 2 is capable of managing torrents,
rapidshare downloads, uploading photo on Facebook and Flickr, and much
more. Whats's wrong with this product? It's <strong>very unstable</strong>! There are
a lot of users that bought this router when it was anounced and they're
still waiting for a lot of bugs to be fixed by Fon developers team
(composed by only ONE person!). Why users had to wait so long?</p>
<p>Simple! They were working to Fonera 2.0n! Wow! Faster router, more RAM,
4 ethernet port, wonderful! But... another very unstable router! And
with unstable I mean: it <strong>disconnects/reboots often</strong>, connection is
unstable, applications don't work ecc.... I'm talking about a 79â‚¬
router, not about something that users had as preview product. Me and
other users were still waiting for an uograde when... Fon <a href="http://english.martinvarsavsky.net/general/fon-to-unveil-new-fonera-at-mobile-world-congress.html">announced a
new
product</a>!
Yes, another one!</p>
<p>Fon priority is not to fix a product that thousand of users have already
bought. Fon priority is to produce and sell a new product!</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>It could be only my opinion, but I don't trust you anymore Fon! I'm
really disappointed about your behaviour you had with your customers.
I've already spent (wasted) a lot of money with your not-working
products and I'm not going to buy your products anymore! I'm tired of
being illuded by your promises: how long are you going to play tricks on
users?</p><p><a href="https://www.andreagrandi.co.uk/2010/02/13/fon-how-long-are-you-going-to-play-tricks-on-users/#disqus_thread">comments</a></p>                </article>
