</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>Developing CuteSoma and maintaining it for three different platforms
(Nokia N9, Windows Phone, BlackBerry 10) is really taking me a lot of
time. I've many features in mind to add but I can't dedicate much spare
time to them and to do it I should take time from other paid projects.
I've also discarded the idea to make CuteSoma a paid app, because it's
been always free (except the Windows Phone one that was non-free for
just a month, but only 6 people "SIX" bought the app).</p>
<p>So I decided to open a <a href="http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/cutesoma-soma-fm-client/x/2353169">fundraising
campaign</a>
on
<a href="http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/cutesoma-soma-fm-client/x/2353169"><strong>Indiegogo</strong></a>
that is a service like <strong>KickStarter</strong>, but it's available all around
the world (not just in USA and UK like Kickstarter).</p>
<h3>What do I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I would like to raise at least <strong>5.000€</strong> to be able to keep maintaining
the existing features and to implement new one. Developing for 3
different platforms really takes a lot of time. I also need to find a
way to get a Windows Phone 8 device because at the moment I cannot test
some features using just the emulator.</p>
<p>What the application currently does:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can view the list of Soma.fm channels</li>
<li>You can listen any channel</li>
</ul>
<p>Features I would like to add:</p>
<ul>
<li>Scrobbling song to Last.fm</li>
<li>Write a new MediaSource for Windows Phone (the default one is quite
    bugged and I need to implement one from scratch)</li>
<li>Port the BlackBerry10 version to the native CascadesUI</li>
</ul>

### The Impact

Funding the development of CuteSoma you will make thousands of people
really happy, because they will be able to listen to Soma.fm on their
Nokia N9, Windows Phone and BlackBerry 10 devices. You will also make me
feel apreciated for all the hours I'm spending to write the code :)

### Completly Opensource
