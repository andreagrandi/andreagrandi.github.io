    <p>
      Posted on Thu 12 November 2009 in <a href="https://www.andreagrandi.it/category/maemo-en.html">Maemo (EN)</a>

          &#8226; Tagged with
              <a href="https://www.andreagrandi.it/tag/ddp.html">DDP</a>,              <a href="https://www.andreagrandi.it/tag/discount.html">discount</a>,              <a href="https://www.andreagrandi.it/tag/maemo.html">maemo</a>,              <a href="https://www.andreagrandi.it/tag/n900.html">N900</a>,              <a href="https://www.andreagrandi.it/tag/nokia.html">nokia</a>
    </p>

  <div>
      <p>Being one of the developers who received the discount to buy a N900,
during these days I contacted the DDP customer care to have more
informations and details. I'll publish here both my original question
and the official reply.</p>
<p><strong>1) The price of N900 is 250€ and I've read of people who paid it this
price. Anyway here you say that the VAT is not included:<br>
<a href="https://pro.forum.nokia.com/site/global/tech_resources/discounted_devices/l_ddp.jsp">https://pro.forum.nokia.com/site/global/tech_resources/discounted_devices/l_ddp.jsp</a><br>
so it should costs 300€ not 250€, right?</strong></p>
<p>The VAT applies only for Finnish developers, for the others the price is
the price they see in the eStore, no VAT is added to that.</p>
<p><em>So, all non-finnish european people, will pay </em><em>250€</em><em> for the N900.</em></p>
<p><strong>2) How much time can I wait before ordering it? In this moment I'm in
Valencia (Spain) and I won't come back to Italy before Christmas. I'd
like the order to be shipped to my home in Italy (I registered as
italian user and I want italian keyboard layout), but I'd like to wait
to order it, because since there's no warranty and I need to tell you
about any problem within a week, if I order it now I will be able to
check it only at the end of december when I'll come back to Italy.</strong></p>
<p>I guess this should not be a problem.</p>
<p><em>This part is not confirmed yet, since Quim told us to hurry up to buy
it.</em></p>
<p><strong>3) How many devices can I buy at that price?</strong> 
Here you say I can buy two: <a href="https://pro.forum.nokia.com/site/global/tech_resources/discounted_devices/l_ddp.jsp">https://pro.forum.nokia.com/site/global/tech_resources/discounted_devices/l_ddp.jsp</a><br>
but here you say I can buy one: <a href="https://pro.forum.nokia.com/showProduct.do?product_id=5096">https://pro.forum.nokia.com/showProduct.do?product_id=5096</a></p>
<p>I don't want two devices, but another friend of mine, who help me in a
project for the Maemo Community, would like to be able to buy one for
the same price (he wasn't able to get the discount because his karma is
still low).</p>
<p>As far as I know, you can only purchase 1x device per person, regarding
MAEMO N900.</p>
<p><strong>4) Where can we find the new firmware? In the FAQ you say: DDP does
not flash devices. It's ok, I can do it, but there's no public firmware
for N900 at the moment.</strong></p>
<p>To update N900, can possibly be using NSU. Nokia software updater.</p>
<p><strong>5) Is it possible to have a device with localized keyboard (for
example italian one) ?</strong></p>
<p>All N900 will have EURO variant, Italian language is one option.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> even these replies come from the official customer care, I
don't assume any responsability if they shouldn't be all exact. If you
have any doubt, please contact them directly at <strong><code>DDP.program@nokia.com</code></strong></p>

    <h2><a href="https://www.andreagrandi.it/2009/02/28/announcing-my-standing-for-the-maemo-council/">Announcing my standing for the Maemo Council</a></h2>
    <p>
      Posted on Sat 28 February 2009 in <a href="https://www.andreagrandi.it/category/maemo-en.html">Maemo (EN)</a>


    </p>
  </header>
  <div>
      <p>After the suggestion from a member of this community (I don't want to
nominate him because I don't want to influence anyone) I've decided to
candidate myself for the Maemo Council. Here I'm! You can read something
about me and about my motivations in the rest of this post.</p>
<p><em>Name:</em> <strong>Andrea Grandi</strong><br>
<em><a href="http://maemo.org/">maemo.org</a>:</em> <strong>Andy80</strong> -
<a href="http://maemo.org/profile/view/andy80/">http://maemo.org/profile/view/andy80/</a><br>
<em>Corporate affiliation:</em> none</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>My name is Andrea Grandi, I'm 28 and I live in Pistoia
(Tuscany, ITALY). I'm a programmer, in particular very interested in
Linux and opensource. I've been working for some years as computer
programmer, then I decided to begin studing at university, and currently
I'm attending at "Università degli studi di Firenze" to get the Computer
Science degree. I spend lot of my time to manage the Pistoia Linux User
Group I founded in 2001.</p>
<h2>My life in the community</h2>
<p>I'm part of the community since I bought my first Nokia 770. I started contributing to the mailing lists, I wrote
some tutorials (in italian language, then I translated them to english)
and I ported SPIM (a MIPS emulator) to Nokia 770. Later I had the
possibility to buy a N810 and I was able to experiment more with the
Maemo SDK. I was at the Maemo Summit in Berlin, doing a light talk about
Maemo development using Eclipse, PluThon and EsBox plugins.</p>
<h2>Motivations</h2>
<p>I really would like to be able to do more for the
community and one of the best way could be to be part of the council, to
help both users/developers to explain their requests to Nokia and Nokia
to understand the requests from the community. There are a lot of
fantastic ideas comung from the community that could improve what we are
doing: the key is to organize them and giving them more attention. This
is what I've always looked for: working together to build something
great!</p>

  <div>
      <p>In these days I was thinking about: <strong>what could be done to improve
Maemo Development and power user experience?</strong> There are some points
that would need to be improved. This little list pretends to be just a
starting point. I hope to get some feedback so we can discuss further in
the <strong>maemo-developers</strong> mailing list.</p>
<p><strong>Documentation:</strong> Maemo developers use different libraries and toolkit
(GTK, libui, ecc...). There is not a common place where I can look for
documentation. I've to visit each library website and get it. It would
be great to have a tool just like Qt Assistant, integrating all
documentation, including examples and aggregating external articles
using a "live RSS aggregator".</p>
<p><strong>Kinetic scrolling:</strong> I really love
<a href="http://mauku.henrikhedberg.com/">Mauku</a> application because of its
kinetic scrolling, thanks to the <a href="http://miaouw.henrikhedberg.com/">Miaouw
library</a>. It would be great to have
this kind of scrolling to be part of Hildon UI. Of course I'd love to
have Python bindings too :)</p>
<p><strong>Eclipse Support:</strong> I think Eclipse support should be improved. I'd
like to have a tool that makes .deb creation easier so developers can
spend more time coding and not packaging applications. I'd like to see a
GUI designer integrated into Eclipse (for "integrated" I mean something
like Visual Studio GUI designer.... not an external tool like Glade).</p>
<p><strong>Qt Creator:</strong> Trolltech (Nokia) just released a preview release of
their <a href="http://trolltech.com/developer/qt-creator">Qt Creator</a>. A very
powerfull IDE to develop Qt/C++ applications. It's still in alpha
release, but... what about integrating Maemo development into it?
(Supporting Python development too).</p>
<p><strong>Maemo SAS hosting:</strong> sometimes we (well.. me at least :D ) need to
write an application that uses a server part too and need to expose some
API. Maemo.org offers hosting for the project, but what about the server
part of the application? It would be fine if developers had the
possibility to have the server side hosted by Maemo.org or Nokia.</p>
<p><strong>Better GPS support:</strong> the GPS unit shipped with N810 is something
unusable yet. I've tried using A-GPS too, but position fixing time is
still bad, compared to an external GPS/bluetooth receiver. I often have
to use my external GPS receiver to use my N810 without problems.</p>
<p><strong>More audio/video codecs:</strong> often I'm not able to listen to online
radios, streamings ecc... just because of a missing codec for the
default Media Player.</p>
<p>These are just some ideas. Please feel free to comment them, I'd like to
discuss them together.</p>
