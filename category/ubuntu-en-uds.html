      <p>When last week <a href="http://fridge.ubuntu.com/2013/02/26/ubuntu-developer-summits-now-online-and-every-three-months/">Canonical announced</a>
the usual UDS was not going to happen I was a bit shocked and
disappointed: starting from the next UDS (that is going to happen
tomorrow!) the event will be <strong>online only</strong> and <strong>every 3 months</strong>.
During these days I've been thinking a lot about this move and I will
tell you what are the pros and cons, in my opinion, followed by some
final thoughts.</p>
<h2>Pros</h2>
<p>Having 4 UDS every year, instead of 2, is surely a better thing. I'm a
big fan of Scrum methodology, so I think that <strong>iterating more often is
better</strong> than iterating less. If there are any mistakes you can correct
them and iterating again before releasing the final product.</p>
<p>Potentially <strong>more people can partecipate</strong> to the event (even the
opposite is true and I will explain why). People won't need to move from
home, travel, pay any expense etc... they just need a computer and a
good Internet connection.</p>
<p>It's <strong>cheaper for everyone</strong>: I can just imagine how expensive could be
for Canonical to organize a similar event. Booking a big hotel, paying
travel and expenses to near one houndred of community people. People who
didn't get any sponsorization had to pay all the travel expenses to
attend the event.</p>
<h2>Cons</h2>
<p>Potentially <strong>less people can partecipate</strong> to the event. Yes, like I
said before even this sentence is true and I will explain why. First of
all, using Google+ there are at least three countries that will be cut
out: <strong>China</strong>, <strong>Thailand</strong> and <strong>Vietnam</strong>. Google+ is not available
in those countries.</p>
<p>Are you sure that special people will be able to follow the event? For
example <strong>blind people</strong> won't be able to chat or to ask question in the
chat.</p>
<p><strong>Only 10 people</strong> will be able to talk. In normal UDS sessions more
people could raise the hand and ask a question or interact with the
track leaders. Who will choose the 10 people with audio+video streaming
rights?</p>
<p>We will <strong>completly miss the social aspect</strong> of the UDS. If you think
this was only a secondary part, please go on. I felt more committed to
work and collaborate with people I met in person than with someone I've
never met before.</p>
<p>Announcing an event, even if online, just <strong>one week before</strong> it
happens. Really? Some people had already taken vacation from work,
booked flights etc... not counting many people that can't take 2 days
off from work just with 1 week notice period. It's also almost
impossible that community members have the time to schedule a blueprint
and be able to discuss about a subject.</p>
<h2>Final thoughts</h2>
<p>From a <strong>cutting costs</strong> point of view I really can't say anything.
Organizing UDS was surely very expensive for Canonical and nobody can
blame them if they decided to spend those money in a different way.</p>
<p>What really concerns me: is UDS still useful? My opinion is that at
least since latest 2 or 3 UDS the presence of the Community was not so
relevant, because I had <strong>the clear sensation that the most important
decisions were made by Canonical before the UDS</strong> and then there was
just some details tuning. Another proof of my thoughts is the today
announcement: <strong>despite the fact that I 100% agree with Unity switching
to Qt/QML</strong> (I already proposed this 2 years ago during Budapest UDS,
but nobody listened to me) <strong>I completly disagree with the way the
decision was made</strong>: not a single involvement or discussion with the
community.</p>
<p>I would apreaciate <strong>more openness and honesty</strong> from Canonical. Do you
want to take all the decisions? That's fine, but at least state it
clearly.</p>

<p>This day at UDS started a bit late for me, since i woke up pretty sick (damn
air conditioned!!!). I did not follow any conferences in the morning. I
relly wanted to follow the <strong>Wayland</strong> one, but when I arrived the room
was already full and it was almost impossible to enter, so I decided not
to enter.</p>
<p>I attended "<strong>What's wrong with UDS and how we can fix it</strong>" session
before having lunch. We discussed the possibility to improve all the
session in general, for example giving them a proper order so that a
team can first discuss some API interface, then another team can discuss
how to design them.</p>
<p>We had another wonderful and tasty <strong>lunch</strong>, even if I didn't eat so
much, but food was very good anyway.</p>
<p>During the afternoon I followed an interesting track: "<strong>Recommend music
based on current song playing or on users media library</strong>". We discussed
the possibilities to implement a music suggestion service, based on
user's tastes.</p>
<p>I spent the rest of theconference time writing these blog posts and
uploading pictures.</p>
<p>After the sessions we had the <strong>Linaro Showcase</strong>: lot of demo running
on Linaro and ARM processors. I was really impressed by a robot with
Kinect that was able to follow people recognizing their faces. During
the showcase there was a very nice dinner.</p>
<p>After dinner I went out with my friend <strong>Manrique Lopez</strong> who is here in
Budapest for another conference, so we decided to meet for a good beer.</p>
<p>Before coming back to the hotel me, <strong>Marco Trevisan</strong> and <strong>Andrea
Azzarone</strong> had a nice talk with <strong>Jorge Castro</strong>. He really make us feel
part of the Ubuntu family!</p>

<p>My day started at 7:30 with a <strong>very nice breakfast!</strong> I was alone with
just another guy this morning, in a very big breakbast room.</p>
<p>After it I grabbed my badge to avoid queue later and went back to my
room to wake up <strong>Marco Trevisan</strong> (he was still sleeping :P ).</p>
<p>The keynote was opened by <strong>Jono Bacon</strong> (the Ubuntu Community manager),
followed by Ubuntu founder <strong>Mark Shuttleworth</strong>. The most interesting
(and tweeted) part of the keynote was "<strong>how to prounounce Oneiric</strong>"
(Oeniric will be the next Ubuntu release).</p>
<p>The keynote finished with a bit late, so all the other tracks were
shifted forward. I followed "<strong>Unity 2D Oneiric Improvements</strong>", it was
interesting because there were some <strong>Nokia/Qt</strong> guys and they looked
very interested in helping the Unity 2D team and collaborating with
them.</p>
<p>Now following "<strong><a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DocumentationTeam/SystemDocumentation/Tasks/Oneiric">Shaping a strategy for Ubuntu user assistance</a></strong>",
I just had the possibility my involvement into helping people that
require Ubuntu assistance.</p>
<p>The <strong>lunch</strong> has been very tasty, I had the possibility to eat some
local recipes, not bad at all.</p>
<p>After lunch we had a short session on <strong>Qt</strong>. The version 4.8 is going
to be released in a couple of months, while 5.0 is announced to be
released in 1 year from now: it will be almost code-compatible with 4.x,
it will have an improved support for Qt Quick and QML.</p>
<p>As last track of the day I decided to follow "<strong>Personal Cloud</strong>". Not a
perfect track, since the person who should have been here was only
talking with us using Skype and it was more difficoult to hear what he
said.</p>
<p>At the end of this day there was the "<strong>Meet &amp; Greet</strong>" party, sponsored
by Freescale and Openstack. They offered a dinner and we had some good
music after it.</p>

<p>I left from <strong>Firenze</strong> with my friend <strong>Marco Trevisan</strong>, to go to
<strong><a href="http://uds.ubuntu.com">Ubuntu Developer Summit</a></strong> in <strong>Budapest</strong>. We
changed flight in <strong>Rome</strong> where we met also <strong>Andrea Azzarone</strong>.
Unluckly <strong>Alitalia losts Marco's baggage</strong>, so he's still waiting for
it.</p>
<p>We arrived at the hotel at 20:00 more or less where we met other people
of the community. There are <strong>lot of italians</strong> at UDS. Most work for
Canonical, other were sponsored by.</p>
<p>I met <strong>Marianna Raffaele</strong> (one of the UDS organizer... yeah, she's
italian too!), I had to explain her a little problem I had with my
booking (nothing bad) and she managed to help me. She also gave me a
very nice guitar plettre with Ubuntu logo. Thank you Marianna for this!</p>
<p>We went out with <strong>Jorge Castro</strong> to drink some beers (he offered me
one, thanks Jorge!!!) and we met lot of other Ubuntu people. A really
amazing start!</p>
