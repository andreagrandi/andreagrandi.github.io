<meta name="description" content="This is a topic I wanted to write about for a while now, but either I didn&#39;t find the time to do it or I didn&#39;t want to do it while I was looking for a new job (or just found one). Before I start I want to make clear that I don&#39;t think all the people working as recruiters are bad. My thoughts are purely based on my personal experience so I will try to explain what have been the episodes which leaded to my current opinions. Hopefully this will be taken as constructive critic from people working in recruitment and will help them to understand more about the people they are supposed to work with. So, here is a collection of things that happened to me in the past. Calling on my mobile without first scheduling a phone call You have no idea (or maybe you have... but if so, why are you doing it?) how uncomfortable can be to receive a phone call from a recruiter while you are at work. It&#39;s also very easy for the colleagues to spot it because 99% of the time people say &#34;this is really not the best time to talk...&#34; or things like that. You may also disrupt an ongoing meeting or discussion or you may interrupt the concentration. Please don&#39;t do it! Agencies that keep calling a candidate against their will Seriously... if I told you once to please remove my telephone number, email and name from your contacts, you just have to do it. It&#39;s my right. It&#39;s the law. Just do it. You can&#39;t pass the contact to another colleague and hope they will have more luck. I&#39;m very annoyed by agencies behaving like this and my advice is (if you live in UK, but hopefully there is something similar in your country) to report these companies to ICO because they are violating your rights and breaking the law. Changing a CV without a candidate knows I found out a recruiter had changed my CV adding more &#34;keywords&#34; to appear more interesting for the companies. This is absolutely disgusting and I think it&#39;s illegal too. Telling someone they are not worth £ xxx Once a recruiter asked me which salary I was looking for. I told them (they had received my CV already) and I was told: based on my experience I don&#39;t think you are worth this salary. How you dare being so rude to someone? I immediately closed the conversation and sent them an email asking to remove me from their contacts. This looked to my a quite dodgy tactic: trying to lower my expectation I could convince myself I&#39;m not worth much and just accept the first thing they propose. Spamming a candidate with unrelevant jobs What&#39;s the point of sending me a job decription where you look for a React frontend developer if my CV never mentioned any frontend work, nor Javascript? Who benefits from this? I don&#39;t. You don&#39;t. The company hiring doesn&#39;t. We all loose. My advice is to spend some time reading someone CV/profile and sending relevant (not just random) jobs. Hiding the name of the company I know, this is a very controversial aspect. Agencies think that if the candidate knows the company name, they will apply directly, skipping the agency and making you loose your &#34;cut&#34;, so they hide the company name and first want a written assurance you will only work with them to apply to that company once the name is disclosed. I have never tried to bypass an agency in the past and I don&#39;t think to be the only honest person in this world. If you don&#39;t tust me, why should I trust you? Sending a job spec to work email How can you think this is acceptable? Do you even expect me to reply? Depending on the job, using employer resources for not work related stuff is not appropriate and can even lead to disciplinary actions. I can&#39;t trust an agency that works like this. Still waiting for a previous apply feedback and sending more jobs It doesn&#39;t work for me, sorry. If I&#39;m still waiting the feedback from an interview I&#39;ve done, I want to concentrate on that one, I don&#39;t want to try another one at the same time. Conclusion All the above things happened to me at least once, I then decided to stop using recruitment agencies when I want to look for a new job. My advice to companies: always have a [Careers / Jobs / Work with us] updated section on your website. That&#39;s the first place where people look. Also: try to engage with existing communities. If your company uses Python, for example, attend Python conferences, meetups etc... you will meet a lot of developers. Bonus points if you host a related meetup. I met my current employer at PyCon UK conference: they had a recruitment desk and a few of them gave a talk at the conference. Surely a nice way to convince a Python developer to work for you! What have been your experiences with recruitment agencies? I&#39;m curious to hear from developers, companies and even from agencies who behave differently from those I mentioned above." />

    <p>This is a topic I wanted to write about for a while now, but either I didn't find the time to do it or I didn't want to do it while I was looking for a new job (or just found one).</p>
<p>Before I start I want to make clear that <strong>I don't think all the people working as recruiters are bad</strong>. My thoughts are purely based on my personal experience so I will try to explain what have been the episodes which leaded to my current opinions.</p>
<p>Hopefully this will be taken as <strong>constructive critic</strong> from people working in recruitment and will help them to understand more about the people they are supposed to work with.</p>
<p>So, here is a collection of things that happened to me in the past.</p>
<h3>Calling on my mobile without first scheduling a phone call</h3>
<p>You have no idea (or maybe you have... but if so, why are you doing it?) how uncomfortable can be to receive a phone call from a recruiter while you are at work. It's also very easy for the colleagues to spot it because 99% of the time people say "this is really not the best time to talk..." or things like that. You may also disrupt an ongoing meeting or discussion or you may interrupt the concentration. <strong>Please don't do it!</strong></p>
<h3>Agencies that keep calling a candidate against their will</h3>
<p>Seriously... if I told you once to please remove my telephone number, email and name from your contacts, you just have to do it. It's my right. It's the law. Just do it. You can't pass the contact to another colleague and hope they will have more luck. I'm very annoyed by agencies behaving like this and my advice is (if you live in UK, but hopefully there is something similar in your country) to report these companies to ICO because they are violating your rights and breaking the law.</p>
<h3>Changing a CV without a candidate knows</h3>
<p>I found out a recruiter had changed my CV adding more "keywords" to appear more interesting for the companies. This is absolutely disgusting and I think it's illegal too.</p>
<h3>Telling someone they are not worth £ xxx</h3>
<p>Once a recruiter asked me which salary I was looking for. I told them (they had received my CV already) and I was told: based on my experience I don't think you are worth this salary. How you dare being so rude to someone? I immediately closed the conversation and sent them an email asking to remove me from their contacts. This looked to my a quite dodgy tactic: trying to lower my expectation I could convince myself I'm not worth much and just accept the first thing they propose.</p>
<h3>Spamming a candidate with unrelevant jobs</h3>
<p>What's the point of sending me a job decription where you look for a React frontend developer if my CV never mentioned any frontend work, nor Javascript? Who benefits from this? I don't. You don't. The company hiring doesn't. We all loose. My advice is to spend some time reading someone CV/profile and sending relevant (not just random) jobs.</p>
<h3>Hiding the name of the company</h3>
<p>I know, this is a very controversial aspect. Agencies think that if the candidate knows the company name, they will apply directly, skipping the agency and making you loose your "cut", so they hide the company name and first want a written assurance you will only work with them to apply to that company once the name is disclosed. I have never tried to bypass an agency in the past and I don't think to be the only honest person in this world. <strong>If you don't tust me, why should I trust you?</strong></p>
<h3>Sending a job spec to work email</h3>
<p>How can you think this is acceptable? Do you even expect me to reply? Depending on the job, using employer resources for not work related stuff is not appropriate and can even lead to disciplinary actions. I can't trust an agency that works like this.</p>

<p>It doesn't work for me, sorry. If I'm still waiting the feedback from an interview I've done, I want to concentrate on that one, I don't want to try another one at the same time.</p>
