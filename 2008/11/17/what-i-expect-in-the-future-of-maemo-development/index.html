</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>In these days I was thinking about: <strong>what could be done to improve
Maemo Development and power user experience?</strong> There are some points
that would need to be improved. This little list pretends to be just a
starting point. I hope to get some feedback so we can discuss further in
the <strong>maemo-developers</strong> mailing list.</p>
<p><strong>Documentation:</strong> Maemo developers use different libraries and toolkit
(GTK, libui, ecc...). There is not a common place where I can look for
documentation. I've to visit each library website and get it. It would
be great to have a tool just like Qt Assistant, integrating all
documentation, including examples and aggregating external articles
using a "live RSS aggregator".</p>
<p><strong>Kinetic scrolling:</strong> I really love
<a href="http://mauku.henrikhedberg.com/">Mauku</a> application because of its
kinetic scrolling, thanks to the <a href="http://miaouw.henrikhedberg.com/">Miaouw
library</a>. It would be great to have
this kind of scrolling to be part of Hildon UI. Of course I'd love to
have Python bindings too :)</p>
<p><strong>Eclipse Support:</strong> I think Eclipse support should be improved. I'd
like to have a tool that makes .deb creation easier so developers can
spend more time coding and not packaging applications. I'd like to see a
GUI designer integrated into Eclipse (for "integrated" I mean something
like Visual Studio GUI designer.... not an external tool like Glade).</p>
<p><strong>Qt Creator:</strong> Trolltech (Nokia) just released a preview release of
their <a href="http://trolltech.com/developer/qt-creator">Qt Creator</a>. A very
powerfull IDE to develop Qt/C++ applications. It's still in alpha
release, but... what about integrating Maemo development into it?
(Supporting Python development too).</p>
<p><strong>Maemo SAS hosting:</strong> sometimes we (well.. me at least :D ) need to
write an application that uses a server part too and need to expose some
API. Maemo.org offers hosting for the project, but what about the server
part of the application? It would be fine if developers had the
possibility to have the server side hosted by Maemo.org or Nokia.</p>
<p><strong>Better GPS support:</strong> the GPS unit shipped with N810 is something
unusable yet. I've tried using A-GPS too, but position fixing time is
still bad, compared to an external GPS/bluetooth receiver. I often have
to use my external GPS receiver to use my N810 without problems.</p>
<p><strong>More audio/video codecs:</strong> often I'm not able to listen to online
radios, streamings ecc... just because of a missing codec for the
default Media Player.</p>
<p>These are just some ideas. Please feel free to comment them, I'd like to
discuss them together.</p>
